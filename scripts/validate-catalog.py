"""Validate every plugin manifest and marketplace catalog in this repository.

Guards the three defects that have actually shipped from this repo more than
once:

  1. An over-long plugin ``description``. GitHub Copilot CLI rejects a
     marketplace whose ``plugins[i].description`` exceeds 1024 characters, and
     it rejects the WHOLE catalog -- every plugin in the marketplace then fails
     to install or update, not just the offending one. Claude Code enforces no
     such limit, so the Claude editions can drift far past it with no local
     symptom and then break the Copilot edition at port time. Trimmed by hand
     three times in the Copilot edition before this check existed; each trim
     reset the length without stopping the growth that caused it.

  2. Version drift between a plugin's own ``plugin.json`` and the marketplace
     catalog entry that advertises it. They are independent files kept in sync
     by hand; a release that bumps one and forgets the other ships a catalog
     pointing at the wrong version. Has shipped four times.

Note on what is deliberately NOT checked: the ``description`` in a catalog
entry and in the matching ``plugin.json`` are not required to be identical.
They are independently authored in practice -- Copilot's ``dt-style-guide``
blurbs, for instance, share no wording at all -- so an equality check would
fail on correct content. The half-fix it might have caught (Copilot's
marketplace trimmed to 964 while its plugin.json stayed at 2091) is already
caught by applying the length check to both files.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate-catalog.py [REPO_ROOT ...]

With no arguments, validates the repository containing this script. Exits 0
when everything passes, 1 on any error. Warnings alone do not fail the run.
