# Splitting one README into a multi-page tree multiplies the places drift can hide. Every
# check below exists because a specific failure was observed -- in this plugin, or
# in the two restructures this one follows (dynatrace-managed-mcp#214,
# ai-containers#78).
#
# --selftest mutates a copy of the passing fixture once per check and asserts the
# gate rejects it. Without that, the fixtures are decorative: a gate that cannot
# be shown to fail proves nothing when it passes. ai-containers' equivalent gate
# passed vacuously on its first run, examining nothing, because its file list came
# from `git ls-files` while the new pages were still untracked.

# broke 24 anchors this way.
# GitHub KEEPS non-ASCII letters in an anchor and lowercases them, and disambiguates a
# repeated heading as name, name-1, name-2. Neither is expressible in `tr`/`sed` without a
# UTF-8 locale -- in a C/ASCII locale those letters are deleted outright, so a CORRECT link
# fails check 2. python3 casefolds and classifies Unicode regardless of locale, and it is
# already a hard requirement of this repo's CI (scripts/validate-catalog.py runs in the same
