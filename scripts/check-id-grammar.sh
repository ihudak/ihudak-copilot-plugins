# Requirement-ID prefixes the plugin mints. NOT a general Jira-key check:
# a real key like PRODUCT-123 is legitimate and must never be flagged.
#
# The number class is [NnXx0-9] everywhere, and identical on all four
# alternations. It covers literal numbers plus every placeholder letter these
# docs actually use -- N, n, x and X. Narrowing it has already cost us once:
# the class was [N0-9] when the conversion ran, so `[SM-Cx]` in vi-reviewer.md
# passed the gate green and had to be found and fixed by hand (2c56b57).
# A bracketed `[US-n]` slipped through the same way while the bare `US-n` was
# caught, because the two branches disagreed about lowercase n.
#
# SM-C<N> (e.g. SM-C1) is the legacy counter-metric form; SMC#<N> is its
# hash-form target and is already covered by the shared prefix alternation
# below -- SM-C needs its own alternative because it doesn't fit the
# \[(PREFIX)-[N0-9]+\] shape (the dash sits before the C, not after it).

# Subtrees that legitimately carry the legacy form, anchored to the SCAN ROOT
# rather than matched by bare directory name. `--exclude-dir=docs` would skip
# any directory called `docs` at any depth -- including a future
# plugins/<name>/docs/ -- which is a silent hole in a gate whose whole job is
# to have no silent holes. `.git` stays a name-match: it is never in scope at
# any depth.

#     worktrees/        never what this gate was asked about. Walking into one reaches
#                       the copy's own scripts/fixtures/, whose deliberate dash-form
#                       negative controls are then reported as live violations -- the
#                       gate goes red on the main checkout for a reason that has nothing
#                       to do with the tree being checked, and it does so during the
#                       merged-result run, the last check before a branch lands. Both
#                       names are excluded because both are what the worktree tooling
#                       creates; only `.worktrees` is in this repo's .gitignore today.

# CHANGELOG.md is history and keeps the dash form (spec Global Constraints).

# purpose. Sanctioned users -- 10 marked lines across 6 files, in three kinds:
#   * reader tolerance (6): jira-reader's five parse rules, and ard-resolution's
#     parse of `## Architecture decisions` -- these ACCEPT the legacy form;
#   * authoring BLOCKER rules (3): vi-reviewer, ard-reviewer, epic-reviewer --
#     these FORBID it in a file their own command just wrote;
#   * readiness-reviewer's MINOR rule (1) -- it REPORTS the legacy form in an
#     artifact the run did not author, without gating the verdict.
# Each has to quote the legacy form in order to accept, forbid, or report it.
# The per-file breakdown is audited so the marker cannot become a general
