# Requirement-ID prefixes the plugin mints. NOT a general Jira-key check:
# a real key like PRODUCT-123 is legitimate and must never be flagged.
#
# The number class is [NnXx0-9] everywhere, and identical on all four
# alternations. It covers literal numbers plus every placeholder letter these
# docs actually use -- N, n, x and X. Narrowing it has already cost us once:
# the class was [N0-9] when the conversion ran, so `[SM-Cx]` in vi-reviewer.md
# passed the gate green and had to be found and fixed by hand (2c56b57).
# A bracketed `[US-n]` slipped through the same way while the bare `US-n` was
# caught, because the two branches disagreed about lowercase n.
#
# SM-C<N> (e.g. SM-C1) is the legacy counter-metric form; SMC#<N> is its
# hash-form target and is already covered by the shared prefix alternation
# below -- SM-C needs its own alternative because it doesn't fit the
# \[(PREFIX)-[N0-9]+\] shape (the dash sits before the C, not after it).
