#!/usr/bin/env node
// check-mermaid.mjs -- every ```mermaid block in every tracked markdown file must parse.
//
// WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. GitHub draws a ```mermaid fence as a diagram, and where the
// diagram does not parse it shows "Unable to render rich display" and a parse error in
// its place. The gate is ported from ai-workflows, where it was written after a broken
// diagram passed every gate there: nothing in that repository parsed mermaid (its
// check-docs.sh's check 15 extracts diagrams, but only to test which commands appear in
// one), so its plugins/product-workflows/docs/workflow.md shipped from product-workflows
// 3.0.0 onward with five unquoted edge labels carrying `[BR#n]`, `[CG#n]/[DG#n]` and
// `[AC#n]/[FR#n]` -- mermaid reads a `[` inside an edge label as the start of a node shape
// -- and it was found by a person opening the page on GitHub. This repository had the
// same blind spot: its check-docs.sh carries the same check 15, and nothing else here
// parsed a diagram before this gate.
//
// FINDING THE DIAGRAMS. Blocks are found with a real CommonMark lexer (marked, pinned in
// package.json), never with a hand-rolled fence scanner. The first version of this gate
// used one, and a release review found three kinds of diagram GitHub draws that it never
// saw -- a fence inside a blockquote, a fence on a list-marker line, and any diagram after
// a line opening with an inline code span of three or more backticks, which the scanner
// took for a fence because it did not know a backtick fence's info string may not contain
// a backtick -- plus a false rejection of a four-space-indented block, which CommonMark
// makes an indented code block that GitHub shows as text. A lexer gets all four right by
// construction. Its count agreed with GitHub's own renderer on ai-workflows' tree.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It runs mermaid's own parser over every block.
// Parsing is the failure GitHub reports, and the gate was calibrated against that report:
// on the broken page it reproduces GitHub's exact error (the same line, the same caret,
// "got 'SQS'"), and across ai-workflows' tree it agreed block for block with a real
// headless render (mermaid-cli, a browser). It does NOT render, so a diagram that parses
// and then fails at layout passes; that class did not occur there, and a render needs a
// browser CI does not carry. A mermaid fence inside a raw HTML block is outside it too, as
// it is outside any CommonMark lexer.
//
// WHERE IT POINTS. A failure names the SOURCE-FILE line, found by content rather than by
// arithmetic. mermaid numbers its errors from text it has already rewritten -- it
// preprocesses twice, removes frontmatter, directives, %% comments and leading whitespace,
// and a diagram's own parser rewrites more (flowchart collapses a `}` followed by blank
// lines) -- so its line number cannot be mapped back by replaying what it did: a replay is
// never complete, and an incomplete one points confidently at the wrong line. What every
// parse and lexical error does carry is the text around the failure with a caret under it.
// locateError finds that text in the diagram, ignoring whitespace and the lines mermaid
// never parses, and trusts it only where it occurs exactly once; otherwise it names the
// fence line and says so. It never guesses.
//
// WHAT IS NOT A DEFECT. A fence that is never closed runs to the end of its container --
// the end of the file at the top level, the end of the item inside a list -- and GitHub
// draws what it holds. So an unclosed fence is not rejected for being unclosed; only its
// content is judged. Where an unclosed top-level fence fails to parse, the report says the
// diagram ran to the end of the file, since that is almost always why.
//
// THE VERSION PIN. GitHub does not publish the mermaid version it serves. The failure
// above reproduced identically on mermaid 10.9.8, 11.17.2 and 12.0.0, so the pin is the
// mature 11.x line. package.json pins exact versions and package-lock.json is committed,
// so neither the parser nor the lexer can change under the gate between two runs; moving
// either is an edit to package.json plus a regenerated lockfile, taken deliberately -- and
// the selftest's line cases are what will say if a new mermaid changes the context it prints.
//
// SCOPE. Tracked markdown only (`git ls-files`), because a tracked file is what GitHub
// renders -- which also leaves out any git worktree copy nested in the tree, whose files
// the outer repository never tracks.
// The one subtree excluded is this gate's own fixture tree, scripts/fixtures/mermaid/ --
// its green cases as well as its red ones, which are broken on purpose.
//
// Usage: node scripts/mermaid/check-mermaid.mjs [--root <dir>]   (default --root .)
//        node scripts/mermaid/check-mermaid.mjs --selftest
// Exit:  0 every block parses; 1 a block does not, or no block was found; 2 usage error.
