# acli — Atlassian CLI skill

An Agent Skill teaching AI agents to drive the official Atlassian CLI ([`acli`](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/acli/)) for Jira and Confluence: JQL search, work items, comments, links, attachments, watchers, projects, sprints, boards, filters, and Confluence spaces, pages, and blog posts.

The skill only needs the `acli` binary on `PATH`; it authenticates via `acli … auth login`.

## Derived from upstream

The skill body is derived from [`ziegenberg/pi-skill-acli`](https://github.com/ziegenberg/pi-skill-acli) (MIT, © Daniel Ziegenberg), vendored here so it can be installed from this marketplace. Changes on top of upstream:

- **Headless-environment authentication** — `--web` OAuth cannot complete in a container (loopback callback, no browser); the token-on-stdin form is documented instead, plus a rule against passing a token as a command-line argument.
- **A Safety section** — classifies commands as irreversible vs reversible-but-disruptive, forbids the agent from adding `--yes` on its own initiative, and requires a `--count` blast-radius check before any `--jql`/`--filter` mutation.

`LICENSE` (MIT © Daniel Ziegenberg) is carried over unchanged.

## Install

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add ihudak/ihudak-copilot-plugins
