Log a corrective interaction, then grill the fix: the argument (text following the `prompt-grill-me:` trigger)

`prompt-grill-me:` is for when a dev-workflows command produced something wrong
and you want a **bounded one-question-at-a-time interrogation** (≤5 questions) of
the correction. It captures the **corrective triple** as plugin feedback, then
grills the fix **inline** following the embedded grilling technique
(`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/grilling-technique.md`). `origin: prompt`.

The interrogation is self-contained — this command owns the grill and has **no
plugin dependency**.

## Phase 0 — Specs-repo preflight

Cite `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline: flush any leftover
session artifacts from an earlier run, retry an artifact commit that failed to
push, and settle the branch. This runs against `$SPECS_PATH` only —
`git -C "$SPECS_PATH"`, never a `cd`, so whatever repository you are standing
in is untouched (§1 rule 1). Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo is
clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it
returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag — the terminal
`commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

---

## Phase 1 — Identify the target

Infer the target command from recent context — which command's output you are
correcting. Ask only if genuinely ambiguous (one grouped prompt, last choice
`"Other… (describe)"`). If no command applies, use `n/a`.

## Phase 2 — Persist the corrective triple

Cite `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and call its
`emit-prompt` entry point (§6). Provide:
- **Friction** — what the command produced that was wrong.
- **User prompt** — the `prompt-grill-me:` argument, **verbatim** (never paraphrased).
- **Resolution** — `Grilled the fix inline`.
- `command` (Phase 1), an inferred `category` (§1 vocab, reuse-first), `impact`,
  `jira_key` (or `null`), `source`.

`emit-prompt` resolves the write target via the §2 specs-first ladder, formats
the entry with the two extra prose blocks (`origin: prompt`), appends per §3
(never silently skipped), and writes silently. Surface the persisted path.

**Then commit session artifacts (terminal).** Cite
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — before the Phase 3
grill, which is interactive and may run long. It stages ONLY the §2.1 bounded
artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
`<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (prompt-grill-me:)` — or
`NOISSUE …` when no `jira_key` resolved — and pushes. It NEVER touches a
code/docs repo, the vault, or the current working directory; NEVER
force-pushes; NEVER fails the run; and skips entirely when the run carries
`specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice. Print its §6 outcome
line here, prefixed `Specs repo:`, with any guard notice repeated in full.

## Phase 3 — Grill the fix (inline)

Interrogate the correction directly, following
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/grilling-technique.md`:
- **Depth:** **bounded** — a capped set (≤5) of the highest Impact×Uncertainty
  questions about the fix, then stop; record any leftover high-impact gaps.
- **Stage:** the correction itself — why the original output was wrong, what the
  right shape is, and what should change so the mistake does not recur.

Follow the technique's mechanics (one question at a time — the bounded rhythm,
which is what makes the ≤5 bound enforceable; a recommended answer
each time, fact-vs-decision split, dependency order, and the confirmation gate
before you act on the result). This command NEVER
commits into a docs/code repo, the vault, or the current working directory.
The Phase 2 `commit-artifacts` step commits ONLY `$SPECS_PATH`'s bounded
artifact paths
(`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md` §2.1).
