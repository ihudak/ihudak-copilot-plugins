# Bug-diagnosis discipline (embedded — shared reference)

Feedback-loop-first discipline for **bug-shaped** SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK tasks. Cited by the
`implement:` skill (Phase 2B) and followed by `risk-planner` when the caller sets `task_shape: bug`.
Adapted from mattpocock `diagnosing-bugs`; aligns with the evidence-before-completion discipline (no
completion claim without fresh verification).

**Who runs the repro.** Step 1's completion criterion requires *executing* a command, so it binds
whoever holds `bash`: the `implement:` orchestrator, and `risk-planner`, which carries `bash` for this
purpose alone. `risk-planner`'s execution is bounded — run the repro and read-only commands, and never
mutate the working tree, the index, `HEAD`, or branch state; the caller owns every write. An agent
without `bash` (`code-review` among them) is never held to the completion criterion and must not be
asked to satisfy it — it consumes the evidence the criterion produced.

## Principle — build the feedback loop before hypothesizing

A bug fix is only as trustworthy as the loop that proves it. Establish a failing, observable loop
first; only then reason about cause.

## Redact before you show anything

This discipline has you show commands, their output, and captured artifacts. **Redact every secret
first** — write `<REDACTED>` in its place. Build the repro loop against environment variables so the
credential stays in the environment rather than in what you show. Captured artifacts are the sharpest
trap: a HAR file, a request log, or a core dump carries auth headers and session tokens, so quote only
the lines that carry the signal, never the whole capture.

If the redacted output is not enough to diagnose the bug, say so and ask — do not un-redact to make
the evidence more convenient.

## Steps

1. **Repro first.** Construct a **red-capable, deterministic, fast, agent-runnable** reproduction
   command that fails *because of this bug* — before forming any hypothesis. Minimize it to the
   smallest input/state that still fails. A bug you cannot reproduce on demand is not yet ready to fix.

   **Completion criterion — one command, already run.** Step 1 is not finished until you can name
   **one** command — a test invocation, a script path, a `curl` — that you have **already run at least
   once**, showing the invocation and its (redacted) output. It must be **red-capable** (it drives the
   actual bug path and asserts the user's exact symptom, so it can go red on this bug and green once
   fixed — "runs without erroring" is not red-capable), **deterministic**, **fast**, and
   **agent-runnable** unattended. A command you have described but not executed does not satisfy this.

   **If you catch yourself reading code to build a theory before that command exists, stop.** Jumping
   straight to a hypothesis is the exact failure this discipline prevents. No red-capable command, no
   step 2.

   **Non-deterministic bugs.** The goal is not a clean repro but a **higher reproduction rate**. Loop
   the trigger, parallelise, add stress, narrow timing windows, inject sleeps. A bug that reproduces
   half the time is debuggable; one that reproduces 1% of the time is not — raise the rate until it is,
   and state the rate you achieved.

   **When you genuinely cannot build a loop**, stop and say so explicitly, listing what you tried.
   A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop; a 2-second deterministic one is worth the
   effort it takes to get there.
2. **Rank falsifiable hypotheses.** List **3–5** candidate causes, each stating (a) what it predicts
   you would observe and (b) the cheapest observation that would **falsify** it. Order by likelihood ×
   cheapness-to-test. A hypothesis you cannot falsify is not a hypothesis — drop it.
3. **Instrument with tagged, removable probes.** Add temporary instrumentation tagged `[DEBUG-xxxx]`
   (a short unique token per probe). Test the ranked hypotheses against the repro. Every `[DEBUG-xxxx]`
   probe MUST be removed before the change is finalized (the `implement:` Phase 3B cleanup gate strips
   them before the review diff is captured).
4. **Fix at the correct seam; regression-test there.** Land the fix and its regression test at the
   **correct seam** (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/design-format.md`
   `## Seams` — prefer the highest seam that still isolates the behavior). If **no correct seam exists**,
   that is itself a finding — record it (the code needs a seam before it can be safely tested); do NOT
   bolt a test onto the wrong seam to manufacture green.
5. **Evidence before the claim.** Never report the bug fixed until the repro from step 1 goes green.
