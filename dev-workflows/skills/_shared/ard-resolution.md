# ARD resolution (embedded — shared reference)

Given a Jira item, resolve any applicable **Architecture Requirements/Decision Document(s)** produced by
`create-ard:` and return a normalized **ARD context** — or **`none`**. Cited by `create-ard:`, `design:`,
`implement:`, `specify:`, `epics:`, and `ready:` so the resolution logic, the **optional/no-regression** rule, and the deviation-record
convention live in ONE place.

## Inputs

`vi` (VI key), `epic` (or `null`), `area` (or `null`), `$SPECS_PATH`.

## Resolution (most-specific first)

1. Resolve the VI dir `$SPECS_PATH/specifications/<VI>-<vslug>/` — match by key-number, tolerating a
   stray `-`/`_` and a human-adjusted slug (the same rule the other commands use).
2. Collect candidate ARD files:
   - **Epic-level** (`epic` set): `<VI>-<vslug>/<EPIC>-<eslug>/<EPIC>_ARD.md` and any
     `<EPIC>-<area>_ARD.md` (the area-scoped file when `area` is given, else every per-area ARD) **plus**
     the VI-level `<VI>-<vslug>/<VI>_ARD.md` for inherited invariants.
   - **VI-level** (`epic` null): only `<VI>-<vslug>/<VI>_ARD.md`.
3. Parse each file's `## Architecture decisions` into `AD#N {id, binds, prevents, rule, source}` where
   `source` ∈ `vi | epic | area`. VI-level `AD#N` are the inherited base; Epic/area `AD#N` layer on top
   (Epic/area wins on any conflict — contradictions were already blocked by `ard-reviewer` at authoring).

## Output — the ARD context, or `none`

```yaml
status: found | none | unmerged
ard_paths: [ <absolute paths of the ARD files used> ]
branch: <carrying branch> | null   # present only when status: unmerged
pr: <open pull request number> | null   # present only when status: unmerged
invariants:
  - id: AD#1
    source: vi | epic | area
    binds: <text>
    prevents: <text>
    rule: <testable statement>
guidance_summary: <short prose: the ARD's non-AD#N architecture guidance the consumer should heed>
```

`status: none` when no ARD file resolves (the common case — `create-ard:` is optional).

`status: unmerged` when an ARD file resolves but is **not on the specs repo's default branch** — verified via `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/phase-handoff.md` §3 (`require-on-main`), which returns the carrying `branch` and any open `pr`. Both are passed through to the caller.

**`unmerged` is reachable only when an ARD file resolves.** An absent ARD is `none`, unchanged — see the no-regression rule below. This status does not make `create-ard:` a prerequisite for anything.

## No-regression rule (central)

A caller that gets `status: none` **MUST behave exactly as it did before this feature** — no prompt, no
extra phase output, no reviewer dimension. The ARD steps are strictly additive and guarded on
`status: found`.

A caller that gets `status: unmerged` **stops**, naming the branch and any open pull request, except `ready:` — which is a read-only verifier and records it as a readiness finding capping the verdict at `PARTIAL`. The distinction matters: reporting a phase as complete while its ARD sits unmerged is exactly the claim `ready:` exists to check.

## Deviation-record convention

When an artifact must NOT honor an `AD#N`, the consumer records — in its **own** artifact, NEVER in the
ARD (role separation: the ARD is the architect's) — a line:

`- ARD deviation: [<AD#N id>] — <what deviates> — <why> — flag: architect`

and surfaces it in the run's final report. A reviewer treats a violating artifact **with** a matching
deviation record as *allowed-but-flagged* (the architect adjudicates), **without** one as a **BLOCKER**.

## Consumers (informative)

- `create-ard:` — reads the inherited VI-level ARD on an Epic-level run (`epic: null` maps to VI-level-only); `AD#N` = the invariants the newly-authored Epic-level `AD#N` must not contradict; `ard-reviewer` checks non-contradiction directly against the drafted file — no separate deviation-record path.
- `design:` — Epic-level ARD = design guidance; VI-level `AD#N` = inherited invariants; deviations → a `## ARD deviations` section in `design.md` + an open question.
- `implement:` — Jira mode only; `AD#N` = implementation guardrails; deviations → the Phase 5 report. Direct mode → `none`.
- `specify:` — keep user stories + scope consistent with `AD#N` + scope; deviations → the spec's `### Open questions`.
- `epics:` — VI-level only (`epic: null`, Epics do not exist yet); `AD#N` = inherited invariants the drafted Epics must respect; deviations → a `- ARD deviation: …` line in the Epic draft + the Phase 9 report.
- `ready:` — VI-level + Epic-level `AD#N` = inherited invariants passed to `readiness-reviewer` as `applicable_ard`; read-only — it never authors a deviation record, only checks the artifacts it reads for an existing one.

The other five pass `invariants` to their reviewer as `applicable_ard`; the reviewer's ARD-conformance dimension is skipped entirely when it is absent. `create-ard:` alone does not: it inherits VI-level `AD#N` read-only straight into its own grill and drafting (Phase 4), and `ard-reviewer` checks non-contradiction directly against the drafted file, never via that field.
