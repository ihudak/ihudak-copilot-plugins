# docs-profile schema

`docs-profile:` writes this file to **`.dev-workflows/docs-profile.yml`** in
the target docs repo. `document:` reads it. `changelog` and `owners` are
intentionally absent — they are owned by the `dynatrace-docs-frontmatter` skill.

images:
  policy: "CDN-hosted; the user uploads to CDN and supplies links; docs reference the URLs; never commit binaries. A CDN URL is immutable. Every new or replacing screenshot is a new URL, and the docs edit is always a URL swap. An image is never refreshed in place."
prerequisites:
  - "a dev server may need a working .docstack toolchain (e.g. an axios>=1.16 shim) before `*:start` boots"

## Field rules
- `spaces[]` is required and non-empty. A single-space repo has one entry and omits `cross_space_override`.
- `dev_servers.concurrent: false` means the consumer must start servers sequentially.
- `dev_servers.readiness_timeout_seconds` is optional (default 120) — how many seconds Phase 6.5 polls a booted server for readiness before falling back to the manual table.
- `commands.per_space` is optional — a map keyed by a space id from `spaces[]`, each entry carrying any of `lint`, `build`, `format`. A multi-space repo that lints or builds each space separately declares it here; consumers run the **lint** command for each space that owns a written file, and the **build** command for every space in the render verification set (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/render-verification.md` §2) — never scoped by which `content_root` the files sit under. Both fall back to the flat `commands.lint` / `commands.build` when the map is absent. A space id in `per_space` that is not in `spaces[]` is a profile error. A per-space entry carrying only some of `lint`/`build`/`format` is not specified — no shipped profile does it. A consumer meeting one should surface the gap rather than guess which fallback applies.
- `commands.build` (flat) and `commands.per_space.<space>.build` are both optional. When neither exists, the consumer treats the dev-server boot as the build proof. Declare a build command whenever the repo has one — an absent build command disables `document:`'s gating build check.
- `commit_convention` is optional — the squash commit-message format Phase 8.5 uses. When absent, the consumer infers it from recent `git log` / `CONTRIBUTING`, else falls back to `<JIRA_KEY> <summary>`.
- `cross_space_override` and `shared_registries` are present only when detected (multi-space / docstack repos).
- `announcement_pages` is optional — hand-authored destination pages that receive a given class of change regardless of where the feature itself is documented, typically inside a tree that is otherwise automation-owned. A repo without any omits the block. Each entry is `{postid, path, kinds}`; `kinds` is an open list of change kinds. `path` is authoritative when `path` and `postid` disagree; `postid` alone suffices when the repo's link convention is postid-based. A declared page is a **cross-cutting** destination: `doc-location-finder` proposes it regardless of which space's `content_root` it sits under, exempt from the `target_spaces` filter, and writes it for another space via the `conditional` strategy.
- `frontmatter.*` are pointers; never copy the rules here.
