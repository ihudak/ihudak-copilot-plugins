# Render verification (dynatrace-docs)

How `document:` Phase 6.5 proves the documentation it just wrote builds
and renders — and that cross-space pages honor the 3a render-unchanged invariant
(the protected space's render is unchanged). See [[multi-space-writing]] for the
write strategies this verifies.

This is the single source of truth for the mechanics; Phase 6.5 cites it and
stays lean. Read every path, command, and port from the resolved `profile` — do
not hard-code dynatrace-docs specifics.

"Affected pages" = every file written or modified in Phase 6.3.

## 1. Build vs boot

Resolve the build command per space: `profile.commands.per_space.<space>.build` when the profile
declares one for that space, else the flat `profile.commands.build`. Run it for every space in the
**verification set** defined in §2 — `target_spaces` plus the protected space of any affected page
whose `write_strategy.strategy` is `conditional` or `override-copy` — never by which `content_root`
the written files sit under. A `conditional` delta lives in its home space's tree but renders only in
its `target_space`, so a path-scoped build compiles the one space that skips the new content.
For dynatrace-docs that is `pnpm dynatrace:build` and `pnpm managed:build` — both exist, and an
earlier version of this file wrongly claimed the repo had only `commands.lint` and the `*:start`
servers, which disabled this gate entirely.

Phase 6.5 does NOT re-run the prose linter — that is Phase 6.4's `docs-style-checker`.

Only when a repo genuinely declares **no** build command at either level does the **dev-server boot
become the build proof** — a server that boots and serves HTTP 200s proves the content compiled. That
is a fallback for repos without a build, not a description of dynatrace-docs.

## 2. Sequential dev-server smoke-check

`profile.dev_servers.concurrent: false` means one space at a time.

**The verification set — which spaces to build and boot.** Start from `target_spaces`. When any
affected page's `write_strategy.strategy` is `conditional` or `override-copy`, **add that strategy's
protected space** — the space that is *not* its `target_space`. The invariant in §4 has two halves
(marker PRESENT in the target render, ABSENT in the protected render) and booting only `target_spaces`
can never check the second one, which is the half the 3a protection depends on. On a run with no
cross-space pages, the verification set is just `target_spaces`.

This set governs **both** gates: §1's build check runs each of its spaces' build commands, and the
smoke-check below boots each of them. Neither is scoped by which `content_root` the written files sit
under.

The two operative consumers — `document:` Phase 6.5 Steps 1 and 2 — restate this set inline rather than citing it alone. That duplication is deliberate: those are instructions a model acts on in one pass, and it may not follow a cross-reference before deciding which servers to boot. Keep both restatements in sync with this definition and do not collapse them into a bare citation. Descriptive references elsewhere (`gate-ledger.md` §4's registry, `docs-profile-schema.md`'s field rules) cite this section and should stay short.

For each space in the verification set, in order:

1. Verify prerequisites (§5) — best-effort, never applied.
2. Boot `profile.dev_servers.servers[<space>].command` in the background; record
   the process id.
3. Readiness poll: GET `http://localhost:<port><base_path>/` until HTTP 200 or
   `profile.dev_servers.readiness_timeout_seconds` seconds elapse (fall back to
   **120** when the field is absent).
4. For each affected page rendered in this space, GET its derived URL (§3) and
   assert HTTP 200.
5. For cross-space pages, run the invariant check (§4).
6. Stop the server (kill the recorded process id) before booting the next space.

Never run two servers at once. Always stop the current one before the next.

## 3. Route derivation

The page URL is `http://localhost:<port><base_path>/<route>`, where `<port>` and
`<base_path>` come from `profile.dev_servers.servers[<space>]` and `<route>` is
the page path relative to that space's `content_root` with a trailing `index.md`
or `.md` removed. Example: `dynatrace/_content/setup/foo/index.md` in the `saas`
space (`base_path: /docs`, port 4000) → `http://localhost:4000/docs/setup/foo`.

This is best-effort. A wrong route that 404s in the smoke-check simply downgrades
that page to the manual table — it is not a render defect by itself.

## 4. Delta-marker extraction and the invariant check

A **delta marker** is a short, distinctive literal string taken from the
per-space content a cross-space write produced — derived here at verification
time, not emitted by Phase 6.3:

- `conditional` page → read the written file and take a distinctive literal line
  from inside the `{{#if project='<target_space>'}}…{{/if}}` block.
- `override-copy` page → take a distinctive literal from the override copy's
  content that is absent in the home-space original.

The invariant check, per cross-space page:
- the marker must be **PRESENT** in the render of the strategy's `target_space`;
- the marker must be **ABSENT** in the render of the protected space.

A marker that appears in the **protected** space's render — or is missing from
the **target** space's render — is a **Critical** finding: the 3a protection
failed.

## 5. Prerequisites (best-effort, never auto-applied)

`profile.prerequisites` lists what a dev server may need before `*:start` boots
(e.g. a working `.docstack` toolchain / an axios shim). Phase 6.5 **checks** a
prerequisite but NEVER applies it — the `.docstack` workaround is a local,
gitignored, reversible dev-environment hack and is out of scope for an automated
run. If a prerequisite is unmet, record "smoke-check skipped for `<space>`:
prerequisite `<x>` unmet" and use the manual table for that space.

## 6. Graceful fallback and the pages-to-visit table

The smoke-check is best-effort. Any prerequisite-unmet, boot-failure, or
readiness-timeout outcome is recorded with its reason and falls back to the
manual table for that space — it never blocks the run. (A 404/500 on an affected
page, or an invariant violation, ARE findings — they are surfaced, not silently
dropped.)

The **pages-to-visit table** is always emitted, one row per affected page: its
URL in each space it renders in (§3), its `write_strategy`, and what to verify
(cross-space rows: "confirm `<target_space>` shows the change and the
`<protected_space>` render is unchanged"). When the smoke-check ran, annotate
each row ✅ 200 / ⚠️ skipped (reason) / ❌ failed.

**Static analysis is necessary but never sufficient.** A correct `{{#if project='…'}}` wrapping, a
clean link-integrity grep, and a verified conditional structure all corroborate the render gate and
none of them satisfy it. Static greps do not catch Handlebars compile errors, do not prove
`managed/docstack.jsonc`'s allowlist actually pulls a shared page into the managed render, and do not
prove a postid resolves in the managed build. A run that has only static evidence has not run this
gate — record `render_smoke_check` accordingly.
