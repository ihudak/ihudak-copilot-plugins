# Documentation grounding on `$DOCS_PATH` (shared reference)

Several authoring commands produce markedly better output when grounded in the
product's existing shipped documentation — current behavior, customer-facing
terminology, and well-documented analogous features to model new work on. When
`$DOCS_PATH` is set and valid, the commands below ground on it automatically so
the operator never has to add "please also check the documentation in `<dir>`".

This governs *whether docs grounding runs and against what root*, and *how the
result is consumed*. It is **read-only**: these commands never write into
`$DOCS_PATH`. Every miss is a **silent, non-blocking skip** — never an error,
never `emit-block`.

Consumers: `idea:`, `create-vi:`, `update-vi:`, `create-ard:`, `specify:`
(grill-rank consumption); `epics:`, `release-notes:` (writer-attach consumption).
`document:` does **not** consume this file — it only uses `$DOCS_PATH` as a
write-target discovery hint (see its Phase 0).

## Procedure — `resolve-docs-grounding <command-name>`

1. **Flags first.** If the invocation carries `--no-docs`, return
   `docs_grounding: OFF`, `reason: "disabled with --no-docs"`. If it carries
   `--docs <path>`, set `docs_root = <path>` and skip step 2.
2. **Resolve the root.** `docs_root = ${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}` (a single
   directory; the AI container mounts docs at `/workspace/docs`, so the default
   lets grounding work even if the var is not re-exported).
3. **Validity gate — ON only when all hold** (else `OFF` with a one-line reason):
   - `docs_root` is non-empty,
   - it is an existing, readable directory (`test -d "$docs_root" && test -r "$docs_root"`),
   - it contains at least one markdown file
     (`find "$docs_root" -type f -name '*.md' -print -quit` is non-empty).
   On a host where `/workspace/docs` is absent, the gate fails → `OFF` → the run
   behaves exactly as it does today.
3.5. **Index state — qmd only.** Skip entirely when `command -v qmd` fails: `retrieval: fallback`, silent, exactly as today. Otherwise probe with `timeout 10s qmd status` and `timeout 10s qmd collection list`. **If either probe fails or times out, treat that exactly as `qmd` absent** — `retrieval: fallback`, silent, no prompt — which mirrors `docs-grounder`'s rung 3 so the command and the agent degrade identically instead of disagreeing about the same broken install. Otherwise take one branch.

   **A collection covers `docs_root`** → `timeout 60s qmd update`. Incremental (qmd re-indexes only changed files), instant when nothing changed, and safe to kill because the index is SQLite and rolls back. On a cap breach, prompt once — never silently pay 60 seconds on every future run:

   ```
   choices: ["Continue with the current index — some pages may be stale (Recommended)",
             "Finish the refresh now — uncapped",
             "Turn docs grounding off for this run",
             "Other… (describe)"]
   ```

   **No collection covers `docs_root`** → prompt once, at plan approval, before any of the run's real work. `<N>` is `find "$docs_root" -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l`:

   ```
   choices: ["Build the docs index now — one-time, <N> markdown files, downloads a ~1.3 GB model on first use (Recommended — every later run is faster and better grounded)",
             "Skip — ground with keyword fallback this run",
             "Turn docs grounding off for this run",
             "Other… (describe)"]
   ```

   On "Build": `qmd collection add "<docs_root>" --name docs` then `qmd embed`, **uncapped** — killing a consented build wastes the work it has already done — reporting elapsed time on completion. The prompt disappears permanently once the index exists.

   **Index building NEVER happens inside `docs-grounder`.** An agent cannot ask, so an agent told to self-heal has only two options: burn many minutes silently, or abort on its own judgment. This step exists because the orchestrator can ask.
4. **Return** `{ docs_grounding, docs_root, retrieval, reason }`, where `retrieval` is `qmd-vector | qmd-lexical | fallback`. `docs-grounder` re-probes and its rung selection is authoritative; this value drives the prompts above and the line below.

**Default-safety note.** A `/workspace/*` default is safe here because this is a
read-only search base — a wrong/missing default just misses and silently skips.
This mirrors `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}`. Write roots (`SPECS_PATH`,
`VAULT_PATH`) deliberately do **not** default; do not change them.

## Plan-approval line

When `resolve-docs-grounding` returns, surface one line in the command's plan/approval (or config-confirm) step, with an off switch. This reference owns the format; consumer commands quote it.

```
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: qmd-vector)
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: qmd-lexical — index has no embeddings)
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: qmd-vector; index refresh exceeded 60s — some pages may be stale)
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: qmd-vector; docs checkout <N> days old — refresh on the host)
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: fallback — no qmd index; build once: qmd collection add "<root>" --name docs && qmd embed)
docs grounding: ON <root> (retrieval: fallback — a project-local .qmd index in <cwd> is shadowing the user-scope one; run from another directory or remove it)
docs grounding: OFF (<reason>)
```

None of the forms above carry the off switch inline — consumer commands state it separately (e.g. "off switch: --no-docs") alongside the verbatim line, per each command's own plan/approval step.

**Docs-checkout staleness.** A fresh index over a stale checkout still grounds on stale docs, and a read-only docs mount cannot be pulled from inside the container. One pure read — `git -C "$docs_root" log -1 --format=%cI`, skipped silently when the root is not a git checkout — appends the clause when the newest commit is more than **14 days** old. That threshold is shared with `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/read-only-repos.md` §5, so the two move together.

**Shadow detection.** `qmd status` prints `Index: <path>` as its first line, which step 3.5 already parses. When that path is not the user-scope `~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite`, a project-local `.qmd` index in the current directory is shadowing it — name that cause rather than reporting a generic miss. A `qmd init` run by hand in a working repo silently disables docs grounding, and the failure is otherwise indistinguishable from never having built an index.

## Dispatch — `dispatch-docs-grounder`

Run only when `docs_grounding: ON`. Dispatch the read-only agent (model tier per
the run's `model_routing` — the `detection_model` §2.1 detection chain is the
default for this retrieval agent):

```
→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:docs-grounder", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  > "Ground this work in the product docs and return the digest:
  >
  > docs_path:       <docs_root>
  > feature_summary: <2–4 sentences: the goal + capability themes for this run>
  > jira_key:        <the VI/Epic/ticket key, or omit for keyless idea:>
  > themes:          [capability themes, or []]"
```

Wait for the digest. On `status: ERROR` or any dispatch failure, treat as
`docs_grounding: OFF` and proceed as today (record one line in the final report).
On `status: EMPTY`, proceed as today; the digest simply adds nothing.

## Consumption

**`grill-rank`** (`idea:`, `create-vi:`, `update-vi:`, `create-ard:`, `specify:`):
Feed `docs_references` to the grill as positive grounding (facts to build on,
analogous precedents to model after, building-block altitude/permissions).
**Rank** each `docs_challenges` entry into the command's existing
Impact × Uncertainty gap list — do **not** append. A docs challenge competes for
a question slot; it never adds one (this preserves `idea:`'s ≤10-question bound).

**`writer-attach`** (`epics:`, `release-notes:`): Pass the whole digest
(`docs_references` + `docs_challenges`) into the writer agent's input handoff as
`docs_grounding`. The writer uses references for consistency and treats
challenges as authoring cautions.

## Invariants

- Read-only; never writes into `$DOCS_PATH`.
- Never blocks; every failure is a silent, non-blocking skip.
- Advisory only — never a gate, never a reviewer BLOCKER.
- Single directory; `${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}`.
- Index **building and refreshing** happen only in `resolve-docs-grounding` step 3.5, never inside `docs-grounder`, which only probes. A build always requires user consent; a refresh runs bounded at 60s and asks only when that cap is breached.
- The validity gate (step 3) checks the docs root, never the retrieval index — Path B works with no index at all, so gating on one would disable grounding exactly where the fallback still works.
- `resolve-docs-grounding` runs **exactly once per run**, at the earliest phase that shows the `docs grounding:` line; any later invocation in that same run consumes the cached result — it never re-prompts, re-probes, or re-refreshes.
