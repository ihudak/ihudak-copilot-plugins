```

`prep.read_only`, `prep.scanned_ref`, `prep.ref_committed_at`, and `prep.head_divergence` are always present, so a caller never branches on absence. Every `evidence.path` is relative to the repo root and denotes content **at `scanned_ref`**; on a read-only mount, open one with `git -C "<repo_path>" show <scanned_ref>:<path>`. See `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/read-only-repos.md`.

## Status codes

| Status            | Meaning                                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OK`              | Every theme was scanned and classified (including `absent`, a legitimate scan result, not a failure). |
| `PARTIAL`         | Scan completed but at least one theme has `classification: error`. Failing themes do NOT abort the scan; mirrors `diff-summarizer`'s `PARTIAL` status. |
| `REPO_MISSING`    | `repo_path` does not exist.                                                    |
| `DIRTY_TREE`      | Working tree is dirty and refresh was requested; orchestrator must escalate.   |
| `REFRESH_BLOCKED` | Ref resolution or a writable-mount refresh genuinely failed (no resolvable default branch, network, auth, non-fast-forward); orchestrator escalates. A read-only mount is NOT a cause — that scan proceeds at `prep.scanned_ref` with `prep.read_only: true`. |
| `EMPTY`           | Repo exists but every theme classified as absent and no relevant files found. Emit instead of `OK` when `capability_map` would contain only `absent` entries. |
