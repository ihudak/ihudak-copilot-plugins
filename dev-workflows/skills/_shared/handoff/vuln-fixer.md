The research report from vuln-research for a SINGLE CVE with `status: READY`, plus:

The `## Research Report` section may arrive inline (as shown below) **or** as a line naming the
absolute path of a `mktemp` file the orchestrator wrote it to. When given a path, `view` the file
first and treat its content as that section.

  # "run-fresh" — vuln-fixer capturing its own — is RETIRED, not merely invalid
  # under a gate. It was invalid under gate_tests_on_review: true because a
  # baseline captured inside the fixer cannot survive the AWAITING_REVIEW

## Research Report (single CVE)
### CVE-2023-46604
status: READY
jira: MGD-2423
description: "Apache ActiveMQ RCE via ClassInfo deserialization"
library: activemq-broker
ecosystem: Maven
vulnerable_range: "<5.15.16"
current_version: "5.15.5"
safe_version: "5.15.16"
files:
  - path: pom.xml
    change: "bump activemq-broker.version from 5.15.5 to 5.15.16"
```

**phase values:**
- `full` (or omitted) — read the supplied baseline → create the fix branch → apply → build → verify. Default. (The first step captures nothing; the orchestrator did.)
  The branch is created **before** the edit, so it exists on every path this agent can
  return from, including `AWAITING_REVIEW`.
- `verify-resume` — second-call protocol after review-tier review. Skip steps 1–4
  (branch, fix and build are already done); resume at step 5 (Verify), after
  re-reading the supplied block's `Status` as step 1 would — its `NO_TESTS` arm
  decides whether step 5 runs at all, and this call does not execute step 1.
- `regression-resume` — second-call protocol after the orchestrator asked the
  user about a `TEST_REGRESSION` return. Skip straight to "Test regression"
  step 4; requires `regression_decision`.

                        # (the agent's steps 1 and 5), since that mark names what the

                        # same reason `CAVEAT: ` is: this field is free text already holding
                        # auto-fix prose, uncovered-suite names and a regression diagnosis, and a

  gate_tests_on_review: true
```

**status values:**
- `SUCCESS` — fix applied, no regression found, branch created with the change on it,
  uncommitted. A `PARTIAL` verify is still `SUCCESS`: every suite the baseline
  covered is green, and `notes` names the ones it does not cover
- `BUILD_FAILED` — build failed after fix, changes reverted
- `TEST_REGRESSION` — previously-green tests failed and were not auto-fixable;
  the fix is applied and built on the fix branch, uncommitted. This
  agent cannot ask the user (subagents have no interactive tools), so it
  stops here — see `notes` for the failing-test list and diagnosis. The
  orchestrator asks the user (per `vuln:` "Handling Test Failures"), then
  re-invokes this agent with `phase: regression-resume` +
  `regression_decision: keep-anyway | revert`.
- `TESTS_NOT_RUN` — `test-baseliner` verify returned `RUN_FAILED` or
  `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`: no comparison was possible, so nothing is known about
  this CVE's tests either way. The fix is applied and built on the fix branch,
  uncommitted, and is **not** reverted — reverting needs evidence the fix is
  bad, and a suite that could not be run is evidence about the environment.
  `notes` carries the report's reason; the orchestrator decides. Distinct from
  `SUCCESS`, which asserts no baseline test was lost — **not that the suite is green**, since a
  `NEW-FAILURE: ` line can stand beside it — and from `TEST_REGRESSION`, which
  asserts they failed
- `BASELINE_FAILED` is **retired** and this agent returns it on no path. It
  reported a `RUN_FAILED` / `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` capture taken inside the fixer,
  and abandoned the CVE with nothing applied — a disposition the orchestrator's
  own paths never shared, and the one an operator is now asked about instead
  (`vuln:` Step 3). A run the operator chooses to have applied unverified
  reaches `TESTS_NOT_RUN` through verify, which refuses a baseline covering no
  suite; a `PARTIAL` capture was never this and still is not
- `REVERTED` — the `regression-resume` call's `regression_decision` was `revert`
- `SKIPPED_BY_USER` — user chose to skip (set by the orchestrator; this agent
  is not re-invoked in that case)
- `AWAITING_REVIEW` — `gate_tests_on_review: true` was set; the branch exists and
  carries the applied fix, the build succeeded, but tests have **not** been run.
  The orchestrator must perform
  the review-tier code review, then re-invoke this agent with
  `phase: verify-resume` to run Verify. Because the branch already exists, an
  orchestrator-side stop here still has somewhere to commit the work
  (`vuln:` Step 3.9 with `clean_finish: false`).
- `BLOCKED` — the research report could not be read at the path the orchestrator supplied;
  nothing was changed. Per the read-failure contract
  (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/context-management.md`), the orchestrator must not
  re-run vuln-research to reconstruct the report — surface the unreadable path to the user
  and stop remediation for this CVE.

### AWAITING_REVIEW output shape

Use this exact shape (omit `tests_before` /
`tests_after` / `regressions` — none of them exist yet; `branch` IS reported, because
step 2 created it before the fix was applied):
