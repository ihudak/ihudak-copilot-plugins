# Code-repo handoff — Shared Reference

Single source of truth for the step that turns finished work in a **code repository** into a commit on its own branch, pushes that branch, and opens a pull request where the host allows one: the `finish-code-branch` entry point (§2). Consumed by `implement:`, `vuln:`, and `upgrade:` — the three commands that create a branch in a code repo and write into it.

**The principle.** Work that exists only in a working tree is one `git checkout` away from gone, and a command that created the branch it was written on owns getting it committed before the run ends. Committing is local and reversible, so it is not the user's to approve. Pushing and opening a pull request leave the machine, so they are.

**Why this file exists.** `implement:` and `upgrade:` each created a branch, wrote into it, ran their gates, and then ended — leaving every change uncommitted, with nothing but the user's own memory standing between a finished implementation and a stray `git checkout`. `vuln:` did commit and open a pull request, but named no mechanics for either: no capability probe, no fallback for a host without `gh`, no defined base branch. All three are now this file's callers.

**Relationship to the other two git references.** Three repositories, three references, no overlap:

| Reference | Repository | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `specs-repo-git.md` | `$SPECS_PATH` | bookkeeping — session artifacts, cost, feedback |
| `phase-handoff.md` | `$SPECS_PATH` | phase deliverables — VI, ARD, spec, design, readiness |
| **this file** | the **code** repo (under `$REPOS_PATH`, or the working clone) | the code the run just wrote |

None of the three ever touches another's repository. A caller runs all three in the same session against different paths, and the outcome lines (`Specs repo:`, `Phase handoff:`, `Code repo:`) are what keep them distinguishable in the run's output.

---

## 1. Hard rules

1. **`git -C "<repo>"` always; `cd` never.** The caller may be standing somewhere else entirely — `implement:` on a multi-source run reasons about several repos at once, and a `cd` would corrupt whichever one it left.
2. **Never the default branch.** The commit lands on the run's own branch or it does not land. This entry point never commits to `main` / `master` / `develop`, and never pushes to one.
3. **Never destructive.** No `push --force`, no `push -f`, no `branch -D`, no `merge`, no `rebase`, no `reset`, no `checkout --`, no `commit --amend`, and never delete an `index.lock`. It also never *drops* a stash: a stash the caller pushed at branch time is the user's, and §2.2 carve-out 2 says so.
4. **Never fatal.** Every failure is reported and the run's remaining phases still execute — including the caller's terminal `commit-artifacts` step, which commits a different repository.
5. **The commit is prompt-free; the push and the pull request are not.** This is the same rule as `phase-handoff.md` §1 rule 7, drawn one step later: there, nothing at all happens without consent because the deliverable is already safe on disk. Here the work is *not* safe until it is committed, and a prompt that can be answered "no" is exactly the failure mode this file was written to remove. So the commit runs unconditionally and §2.4's choice governs only what leaves the machine.

**Where this reference deliberately differs from its siblings.** Both `specs-repo-git.md` (§1 rule 2) and `phase-handoff.md` (§1 rule 2) forbid `git add -A` at repository scope: there, the repository holds artifacts belonging to many runs and to the user, so only enumerated paths may be staged. **This entry point stages at repository scope on purpose** (§2.2), because in a code repo the run branched off a verified-clean tree and the whole diff *is* the deliverable — staging an enumerated subset would commit part of an implementation and silently drop the rest, which is the failure this file exists to prevent. The bound is moved rather than dropped: it is the **clean-tree precondition plus §2.2's `pre_existing_dirty` carve-out** that keeps somebody else's work out of the commit, and where that precondition does not hold, §2.2 falls back to staging by enumeration exactly as the siblings do. A reader who "corrects" §2.2 to match the siblings breaks this contract; a reader who carries §2.2's repository-scope staging back into either sibling breaks theirs.

---

## 2. `finish-code-branch` — the entry point

Called once per branch the run finished work on, at the point where **every** in-repo write is done — including the caller's post-implementation maintenance agents, which edit `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and in-repo memory files. A call placed before those agents run leaves their edits outside the commit, which is the one ordering mistake this step can make.

### 2.1 Gate

Resolve the base branch (§2.7) **first** — the gate's last check needs its value. Then require all of:

1. `repo` is set and is an existing directory, and `git -C "<repo>" rev-parse --git-dir` succeeds.
2. `git -C "<repo>" symbolic-ref --quiet --short HEAD` succeeds (HEAD is on a branch, not detached). **`--short` is required**: without it the command prints `refs/heads/<name>`, which can never compare equal to the short name §2.7 resolves, so checks 3 and 4 would both silently pass on every run.
3. That name is **not** the resolved base branch.
4. That name **equals the caller's `branch` input**. `git commit` writes to HEAD while `git push -u origin <branch>` pushes the ref *named* `<branch>`; if the two differ both succeed and the run reports a push that never happened. Mismatch is a gate failure naming both values, never a silent correction.

**Writability is not pre-probed.** Attempt the commit and let a real `Read-only file system` error be the trigger (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/read-only-repos.md` §1's own secondary trigger). That file's `test -w` probe is written for a *scanner*, where it says in as many words that a false positive is benign because the agent just reads at a ref instead. Here the same probe would decide whether finished work is committed at all, and a false positive strands it — and note that a genuinely read-only mount would have failed the caller's Write/Edit tools hours earlier, so nearly every firing of a pre-probe here is a false positive.

A failed gate is reported through §3.1's `NOT committed` line and the run continues. Detached HEAD is worth naming rather than merely reporting: it is the same blocking state `specs-repo-git.md` §3.3 G0 names, for the same reason — a commit made there is reachable from no ref. Report it; never create a branch to escape it, because the branch this run was supposed to be on is not the one this step gets to choose.

**No `origin` remote is not a gate failure.** §2.7's ladder is unresolvable without one, so checks 3 and 4 fall back to comparing HEAD against the caller's `branch` input alone, the commit proceeds, and §2.5 reports that there was nothing to push. A local-only clone is a legitimate setup and must never cost the user their commit.

### 2.2 What gets staged

**The precondition.** The caller is responsible for establishing, before its first file edit, that the tree held nothing it did not put there — `implement:` at Pre-Phase 3 step 1 and `upgrade:` at Phase 2 prep step 1 do it with an explicit dirty-tree prompt, and `vuln:` does it by capturing the porcelain set at the top of Step 3 and passing it as `pre_existing_dirty` (it never prompts, so on `vuln:` a non-empty set always takes carve-out 1 below rather than the `add -A` path). Where the tree was established clean, everything uncommitted in the repo now **is** this run's work — the same reasoning `finish-and-handoff.md` §2 applies to the docs repo — and staging is `git -C "<repo>" add -A`.

Enumerate before staging regardless: `git -C "<repo>" status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`. `--untracked-files=all` is required because the default collapses an untracked directory to a single `?? dir/` line, which would hide individual files from carve-out 1's set subtraction below.

Three carve-outs:

1. **`pre_existing_dirty` is non-empty.** The precondition does not hold, and `add -A` would sweep somebody else's uncommitted work into this run's commit. Stage by enumeration instead: the current porcelain set **minus** the recorded paths. **A path that was already dirty and that this run also edited is staged**, because the run's edit is inside that file and cannot be separated from what was there before; list those paths in the §3.1 line rather than deciding them silently.

   This is a **rule, not a prompt.** An earlier draft asked the user to choose between enumeration, whole-tree staging, and skipping the commit; that reintroduced exactly the "prompt that can be answered no" §1 rule 5 exists to remove, offered a skip option that contradicts the unconditional commit, and fired once per unit in a loop. The subtraction is the safe answer in every case, so it is taken without asking, and the §3.1 line reports how many pre-existing paths were left alone.

2. **A stash the caller pushed.** Never restored here and never dropped. It stays where it is and §3.1's line names it, because a stash nobody mentions is a stash nobody remembers.

3. **Temp files are already out of reach.** Every caller writes its diffs, claims files, and scan summaries to `mktemp -t …` outside any repo tree specifically so `add -A` cannot pick them up. This step does not re-verify that; a caller that writes a temp file inside the tree breaks this step's staging, which is why the rule sits in the callers.

**Nothing staged.** Do **not** emit a line here — §3.1 allows exactly one per call, and this path continues. If the branch carries commits this run made earlier (the §2.11 split form), proceed to §2.4 and report the run's outcome from the pushing rows. If it carries none, the call ends and §3.1's `no changes to commit` row is the line. An `upgrade:` component already at its target version, or a re-run that changed nothing, both land here legitimately.

### 2.3 Commit

**Message.** The caller's own documented template wins when it has one — `vuln:`'s "Git Workflow → Commit message" is the one that exists today. Otherwise derive the subject from the repository, never from habit: read `git -C "<repo>" log --oneline -20` and match what it shows. A log of `<KEY> <summary>` subjects gets `<KEY> <summary>` when the run resolved a Jira key; a conventional-commits log gets `feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` matching the type the run's own branch prefix already expresses (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/branch-naming.md` §2.4 lists each command's fallback prefix, but a repo with its own documented convention may have supplied a different one — read what the run resolved, not the fallback table); a log with neither gets a plain imperative subject.

**Body.** What changed and why — one line per notable item — plus the review verdict where the caller has one, and the test result where the caller ran tests. **Trailer.** The caller's, when its template carries one; default `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>`.

**Write the whole message to a file and commit with `-F`:**

    git -C "<repo>" commit -F <msg-path>

`<msg-path>` is a `mktemp -t` path **outside any repo tree** (§5). This is `phase-handoff.md` §2.7's rule applied to the commit message, and it is not stylistic: `-m "…"` inside a double-quoted shell string command-substitutes `$(…)` and backticks before git ever sees the text, and `vuln:`'s template interpolates an NVD CVE description — free text, routinely containing shell metacharacters and version expressions — straight into it. `upgrade:` interpolates component names and `implement:` a free-text summary, with the same exposure. `-F` also preserves the multi-line body and trailer that `-m` would mangle.

Never `--amend` (§1 rule 3): an amend rewrites a commit that may already be pushed, and this step is reachable more than once per run.

**A rejected commit is a reported failure, never a silent one.** A `pre-commit` / `commit-msg` hook can reject the commit; the changes then stay staged. Do not retry, do not bypass with `--no-verify`, and do not proceed to the next unit as though the commit landed — a later unit's `add -A` would fold this unit's diff into that unit's commit under the wrong message. Record the failure and its hook output; in the §2.11 split form the caller reports it in its own per-unit results table, and the terminal call's §3.1 line names the count of units that failed to commit.

### 2.4 The consent choice

Asked **after** the first successful commit, and presented verbatim — order, wording, and the `(Recommended)` marker are not the caller's to change:

    choices: ["Push the branch and open a pull request (Recommended)", "Push the branch only — no pull request", "Neither — the commit stays on this machine"]

There is deliberately no `Cancel`: the commit has already happened, so there is nothing left to cancel, and the third option *is* the decline.

**Asked once per run, then reused** — record it as `code_handoff_choice`. `vuln:` finishes one branch per CVE and `upgrade:` commits once per component; re-asking would turn a single decision into one per unit of work, which is how a prompt becomes something a user clicks through without reading.

**Two triggers re-ask, and only these two.** First, the run's `clean_finish` changing from `true` to `false` since the answer was given: the user authorised pushing reviewed work, not blocked work, and the reverse — declining on a blocked first unit and thereby silently withholding nine clean ones — is just as wrong. Second, a change of `repo`. Re-asking names the trigger so the user knows why they are being asked twice.

### 2.5 Push

`git -C "<repo>" push -u origin <branch>`. Never force.

- **No `origin` remote** → nothing to push; the call ends and §3.1's `no origin remote` row is the line (§2.1 already established this is not a failure).
- **Non-fast-forward rejection** → reported, never resolved by rebasing, resetting, or forcing. The branch is the run's own, so this means somebody else pushed to it; that is a human's call. Server-side rejections (protected-branch pattern, `pre-receive` hook, size or LFS limits) report the same way, through §3.1's `push FAILED (<reason>)` row.
- **A failed push never undoes the commit and never starts a retry loop.** The commit is the durable half and it survives every push failure — which is the whole reason §1 rule 5 puts it first.

### 2.6 Open the pull request

**First, probe for an existing pull request** — a re-run against a branch that already has one is ordinary, not exceptional:

    gh pr list -R "<owner_repo>" --head <branch> --state open --json number,url

One already open ⇒ the push in §2.5 has already updated it. Report it as the run's pull request (§3.1 rows 1–2) and do **not** call `gh pr create`, which would fail on the duplicate and send the run down §3.2 telling the user to open a pull request that exists. This is `phase-handoff.md` §3.5's primitive, applied here.

A `gh pr create` that exits 0 but prints nothing parseable as a number or URL is **not** treated as a failure — the pull request very likely exists, and falling back to §3.2 would tell the user to open a second one. Report it with the dedicated §3.1 row instead.

Otherwise derive the repository and create it. Run the cheap `gh auth status` pre-check first, purely so a missing login reports as a login problem rather than a raw `gh` error, then supply every argument that would otherwise make `gh` prompt — the plugin must never block on an interactive editor:

    url=$(git -C "<repo>" remote get-url origin)
    host=$(printf '%s' "$url" | sed -E 's#^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]*://##; s#^[^/@]+@##; s#[:/].*$##')
    slug=$(printf '%s' "$url" | sed -E 's#^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]*://##; s#^[^/@]+@##; s#^[^/:]+(:[0-9]+)?[/:]##; s#/+$##; s#\.git$##')
    case "$host" in github.com) owner_repo="$slug" ;; *) owner_repo="$host/$slug" ;; esac

    gh pr create -R "$owner_repo" --base <base> --head <branch> \
                 --title "<title>" --body-file "<body-path>" [--draft]

**The host is kept, not stripped.** `gh -R` accepts `[HOST/]OWNER/REPO`, and `gh auth status` succeeds whenever the user is authenticated to *any* host — so a bare `OWNER/REPO` derived from a GitHub Enterprise remote resolves against **github.com**, silently targeting an unrelated public repository if one happens to sit at that path. Only `github.com` may drop the host. Validate the slug against `^[^/]+/[^/]+$` before calling `gh`; anything else (a Bitbucket `scm/proj/repo`, a nested GitLab group) is not a `gh` target — skip to §3.2.

The `sed` expressions strip, in order: a scheme (`ssh://`, `https://`), a `user@`, and a host with an optional `:port` terminated by `/` **or** `:` (the scp-like `git@host:Org/repo` form uses a colon), then a trailing slash and the `.git` suffix. Verified against `git@host:Org/repo.git`, `https://host/Org/repo(.git)`, `https://user@host/Org/repo.git`, `ssh://git@host/Org/repo.git`, `ssh://git@host:7999/proj/repo.git`, `git@ghe.corp:Team/repo.git`, and a nested `group/sub/repo`. A two-expression form matching only `git@host:` or `https://host/` passes an `ssh://…` URL through **unchanged** — do not simplify it back.

**Capability probe, not host classification.** Try the call; on any failure fall back to §3.2. Push authority and pull-request authority are independent — push runs over SSH with a per-repo key, `gh` runs over the API with a token, and the same account can have write access to one repository and read access to another. No hostname test can detect that mismatch, which is why `finish-and-handoff.md` §4's host classification is right for choosing *instructions* and insufficient here.

`gh` wraps the API rather than calling it over HTTPS, which is what the zero-direct-API rule permits.

### 2.7 The title and the body file

Title: the commit subject of §2.3.

Body: **written to a file** — `<body-path>`, a `mktemp -t` path outside any repo tree — never passed inline, which would break on newlines and quoting. It contains what the run produced (`body_facts`), the files changed, the reviewer verdict where the caller has one, the test result, and, on a `clean_finish: false` run, §2.8's banner as its **first line**. The same file is what §3.2 names when `gh` is unavailable, so the user pastes the identical body — banner included — into the web UI.

### 2.8 Resolving the base branch

In order, stopping at the first that succeeds — never assume `main`:

1. `git -C "<repo>" symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` → strip the leading `origin/`; what remains is the name. `--quiet` is required, or a clone whose `origin/HEAD` is unset leaks `fatal: ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD is not a symbolic ref` into the run's output.
2. For `main`, then `master`, then `develop`: `git -C "<repo>" rev-parse --verify --quiet origin/<name> >/dev/null` — and on success take **`<name>`**, never the command's output.

**Rungs 2–4 are existence probes, not name sources.** `rev-parse` prints a 40-character SHA, so a caller that uses its stdout gets a SHA: `git switch <sha>` detaches HEAD — the state §2.1 treats as blocking — and `gh pr create --base <sha>` is rejected outright. Redirect the output and use the literal name you probed.

An exhausted ladder (or no `origin`) means no pull request can be opened: report it through §3.1 and skip §2.6.

### 2.9 A run that did not end clean

`clean_finish: false` when the caller reports any of:

- an Opus review verdict still `BLOCK` after its single allowed fix cycle plus re-review;
- test regressions the user chose to keep rather than fix or revert;
- a unit of work the caller marked `BLOCKED` (a `vuln:` CVE, an `upgrade:` component) **that reached the repository** — a unit that stopped before writing anything (an unreadable input, a failed baseline) changed nothing and must not flip the flag for the rest of the batch.

**Commit and push run exactly as they would on a clean finish.** Unreviewed work that exists is recoverable; work that was never committed is not, and a failed gate is the case where losing it hurts most. What changes is only the pull request:

- opened with `--draft`, so it cannot be merged by reflex;
- the body file's **first line** is `> ⚠ DO NOT MERGE — <blocking facts>.`, listing **every** blocking fact when a batch has more than one, semicolon-separated. One slot, all the facts.
- where §2.6 fell back, §3.2 carries the same banner as its own first line **and** appends `--draft` to the copy-paste `gh` command it offers, and its web-UI wording says to open the pull request as a draft. A fallback that quietly produces a mergeable pull request for blocked work defeats this whole section.

### 2.10 Failure discipline

Never fatal (§1 rule 4). Every failure is reported, and no report may imply a step succeeded that did not. "Committed", "pushed", and "pull request opened" are three separate claims, and a run that committed but could not push says both of the first two.

### 2.11 Caller-supplied inputs

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `repo` | absolute path of the code repository |
| `branch` | the branch the caller created or adopted — §2.1 check 4 verifies HEAD is actually on it |
| `pre_existing_dirty` | porcelain paths dirty before the run's first edit, or `null` |
| `stash_ref` | the stash the caller pushed at branch time, or `null` |
| `title` | the commit subject and pull-request title |
| `body_facts` | what §2.7 renders into the body file |
| `clean_finish` | `true` / `false` per §2.9 |
| `commit_template` | the caller's own message template, or `null` |

### 2.12 Splitting the call across a loop

A caller whose units **share a single branch** — `upgrade:`'s per-component loop — may run **§2.1–§2.3** at the end of each unit and the **full entry point once** at the end of the run. The unit-level call commits and stops; the terminal call finds nothing left to stage, takes §2.2's `nothing staged` path, and continues into §2.4 and §2.5–§2.6 because the branch carries commits to push.

**§2.1 is inside the split, not outside it.** An earlier draft sanctioned "§2.2–§2.3 alone", which ran every per-unit commit with no gate: a caller whose branch creation had failed would commit its whole batch onto the default branch, one commit per unit, and only discover it at the terminal call — which would then report `NOT committed` over work that was very much committed, in the wrong place. Run the gate every time; it is four cheap reads.

The split is what makes per-unit committing worth having: a batch that dies on component three still has one and two committed, each with its own message, on a branch that bisects. Both halves are required — a caller that runs the unit-level half and never reaches the terminal call has committed the work and left it on the machine, which is only half the fix.

**Where each unit gets its own branch there is no split.** `vuln:` is that case: a unit-level call that only committed would leave that CVE's branch unpushed forever, since the terminal call can push only the branch it is standing on. Each CVE runs the **full** entry point, and §2.4's once-per-run caching keeps that from asking N times.

**A unit-level call emits no §3.1 line** (§3.1 allows one per *full* call), but it is not silent: it returns its outcome — commit sha, `nothing staged`, or a commit failure with its reason — to the caller, which records it in its own per-unit results table. §2.10's "every failure is reported" is satisfied there, not by a `Code repo:` line.

---

## 3. Reporting

### 3.1 Outcome line

Exactly one per **full** call, prefixed `Code repo:`. A caller that finishes several branches in one run (a `vuln:` CVE loop) emits one line per branch. A §2.12 unit-level call emits none.

`<what>` below is `<sha7> on <branch>` for a call that committed, and `<n> commit(s) on <branch>` for a terminal call whose own staging was empty but whose branch carries commits from unit-level calls.

| Case | Line |
|---|---|
| Pushed, PR opened | `Code repo: <what> — pushed, PR #<num> open (<url>).` |
| Pushed, draft PR | `Code repo: <what> — pushed, DRAFT PR #<num> open (<url>) — <blocking facts>.` |
| Pushed, PR already existed | `Code repo: <what> — pushed to existing PR #<num> (<url>).` |
| Pushed, no PR requested | `Code repo: <what> — pushed. No pull request opened (not requested).` |
| Pushed, PR not opened | `Code repo: <what> — pushed, PR NOT opened (<reason>). Open it manually.` |
| Pushed, PR opened but unparseable | `Code repo: <what> — pushed, pull request opened but `gh` returned no usable number or URL; check the branch on the host.` |
| Pushed, PR not opened, run blocked | `Code repo: <what> — pushed, PR NOT opened (<reason>) — <blocking facts>. Open it manually as a DRAFT.` |
| Push failed | `Code repo: <what> — push FAILED (<reason>). The work IS committed locally.` |
| Push declined | `Code repo: <what> — not pushed at your request.` |
| No origin remote | `Code repo: <what> — no origin remote, nothing to push.` |
| Nothing to commit, nothing to push | `Code repo: no changes to commit on <branch>.` |
| Commit rejected by a hook | `Code repo: NOT committed — <n> unit(s) rejected by a <hook> hook (<reason>). The changes are staged.` |
| Gate failed | `Code repo: NOT committed — <reason>. Your changes are still in the working tree.` |
| Pre-existing dirty paths skipped | append `; <n> pre-existing dirty path(s) were left uncommitted.` |
| A stash is outstanding | append `; a stash from this run's branch step is still on the stack (<stash_ref>).` |

The `push FAILED` line states the surviving commit explicitly. A user reading "FAILED" needs to know in the same sentence that their work is not gone.

### 3.2 The no-`gh` fallback text

On a `clean_finish: false` run the banner is the **first** line, above everything else, and it is also the first line of `<body-path>` (§2.7) so it survives the paste:

    > ⚠ DO NOT MERGE — <blocking facts>.

    The branch is pushed but no pull request was opened (<reason>).
    Open one from <branch> into <base> in the web UI — as a DRAFT if the banner above is present.
    Title: <title>
    The body is at <body-path>.

For a GitHub remote where `gh` is merely absent, append the command the user may run once it is installed — carrying `--draft` whenever the banner is present, or the fallback silently produces the mergeable pull request §2.9 exists to prevent:

    gh pr create -R <OWNER_REPO> --base <base> --head <branch> \
      --title "<title>" --body-file <body-path> [--draft]

---

## 4. Caller contract

Four obligations. Omitting any one is a defect, not a style choice.

1. **Call it after the last in-repo write, not before.** Post-implementation maintenance edits files inside the repo; a call placed ahead of them commits a partial run.
2. **Record `pre_existing_dirty` and `stash_ref` at branch time.** A caller that does not cannot honour §2.2's first two carve-outs, and will either sweep up somebody else's work or forget a stash.
3. **Emit §3.1's line exactly once per *full* call**, in the run's own report. A §2.12 unit-level call emits none — it returns its outcome to the caller instead (§2.12), which records it in that command's own results table.
4. **Never restate this reference's rules** — cite the section number. A rule copied into a command is a rule that goes stale.

## 5. What this entry point never does

- Never touches `$SPECS_PATH`, a docs repo, or the vault — those are `specs-repo-git.md`, `phase-handoff.md`, and `finish-and-handoff.md` respectively.
- Never merges a pull request, and never approves one.
- Never calls a REST API over HTTPS. `git push` is git-protocol; `gh` wraps the API (§2.6).
- Never writes a file into the repository it is committing. Everything it needs — the pull-request body included — is written outside the tree.
