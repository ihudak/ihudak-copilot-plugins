# Escalation rules (shared)

Canonical `choices:` arrays for escalation decision points. Every decision
point uses a `choices:` array whose **last** entry is `"Other… (describe)"` where
applicable. Command bodies are authoritative; where `document:` and `epics:`
differ for the same scenario, both variants are listed.

## Choice lists are presented verbatim

**A choice list written into a command phase is presented to the user verbatim. Its options, their
order, their wording, and the `(Recommended)` marker are not the orchestrator's to change. An
orchestrator that believes a different option is correct for this run says so in prose alongside the
list — it never edits the list.**

This rule binds every command in the plugin, not only the ones documented below. It exists because a
`document:` run presented Phase 6.5's `["Run smoke-check (Recommended)", "Skip — use the manual table
only", "Cancel"]` with the recommendation moved onto Skip, and the render gate was never exercised.

Adding the trailing `"Other… (describe)"` entry where a phase omits it is the one permitted
adjustment.

## The `(Recommended)` marker is unconditional

**A `(Recommended)` marker applies whenever its list is shown.** A marker that carries its own
condition — `(Recommended for <case>)`, `(Recommended if <case>)` — is malformed: it hands the user
the gate the command was supposed to evaluate, and it cannot be honoured verbatim by an orchestrator
that must not edit the list. Write it one of two ways instead:

- the condition **gates the prompt** (the list is only shown in that case) → the marker is a plain
  `(Recommended)`; or
- the condition **lives in the option's own description** → the list carries no marker at all.

A **reason** annotation is not a condition and is fine: `(Recommended — <why>)` states why the option
is recommended, unconditionally, and is honoured verbatim like any other marker (`document:`
Phase 5 and `epics:` Phase 1 both use it).

When no option is safe to recommend across the runs that reach a prompt, omit the marker and say so
in prose beside the list (as `document:` Phase 5.6 does for its per-occurrence image review).

This rule binds every command in the plugin, not only the ones documented below.

## When a choice list fires

**A choice list blocks whenever it is shown.** Presenting one and continuing without an answer is never
correct — the list *is* the wait.

**A list is shown only when its firing condition holds.** A list with no written condition is shown
every time its phase runs. That is the default, and it is the right default for most phases.

**A list written for a question whose answer is already determined is a defect**, not a formality — it
spends a user turn on a prompt with one plausible answer. Where the answer is determined on some runs
and open on others, write the firing condition and keep the list for the runs where it is open.

**The inline-confirmation form.** When the answer is determined, state the resolution in one line that
names what was resolved and how to correct it, then proceed without waiting:

```
Reading this as a <type> — say so if it's actually a <other-type>.
```

An inline confirmation is **not** a choice list: it carries no `choices:` array, it never waits, and the
run continues on the stated resolution. It is the correct form wherever a phase would otherwise ask a
question with one plausible answer.

This rule governs only *whether* a list is presented. Option wording, option order, and the
`(Recommended)` marker are governed by the two rules above and are untouched by it.

This rule binds every command in the plugin, not only the ones documented below.

## Jira key dir not found

`choices: ["Re-enter key", "Cancel"]`

Used when `jira-reader` returns `status: NOT_FOUND` or `status: EMPTY`, or when
Phase 0 of `jira-reader` rejects an invalid `jira_key` format.

## Repo unresolved (zero matches) — document:

`choices: ["Skip and continue without its PRs", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 4 when a repo slug has zero matches in the
slug→clone map.

## Repo unresolved (zero matches) — epics:

`choices: ["Skip and continue without this repo's scan", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `epics:` Phase 4 when a repo slug has zero matches in the
slug→clone map.

## No repos derivable — epics:

`choices: ["List repos to scan manually", "Proceed without code scan", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `idea:` Phase 2.6 when the proposed theme → repo mapping is empty (no
theme matches any mounted repo), and in `epics:` Phase 4 when the final
resolved repo list is empty (every repo was skipped or missing — "Use case B
with no repos derivable"). The `— epics:` suffix on this heading is historical
— `epics:` was its first citer — not a scope restriction; the rule now serves
both workflows listed above, and any future citer with the same
empty-repo-set shape uses it too.

## Repo missing (after resolution)

`choices: ["Skip this repo", "I'll clone it — wait", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used when a diff-summarizer or code-scanner batch returns `REPO_MISSING` at
Phase 5, after Phase 4 already checked, in `idea:` Phase 2.6, which has no
earlier check, and in `implement:` Phase 1.7. `REPO_MISSING` means `repo_path`
is not a directory **or** the clone's `origin` slug does not match
`repo_url_slug`; *Specify a different absolute path for this repo* is the
option that resolves the second case, which the previous list had no answer
for at all. Present this choice per affected repo. No `(Recommended)` marker —
which option is right depends entirely on why the repo is absent.

## Dirty working tree

`choices: ["Stash changes and retry this repo", "Skip this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 5 when a diff-summarizer returns `DIRTY_TREE`. `create-ard:`, `design:`,
`release-notes:`, and `implement:` (Phase 1.7) cite this rule by name without reproducing the list, so
per the "Choice lists are presented verbatim" convention above they use this variant — the one written
under this heading.

In `epics:` Phase 5 the `"Other… (describe)"` entry is omitted:
`choices: ["Stash changes and retry this repo", "Skip this repo", "Cancel"]`

`specify:` (Phase 4) reproduces this shorter `epics:` variant inline as well. A new citer that reproduces
a list inline states which variant it uses; a citer that names the rule without reproducing the list
uses the `document:` variant above — the file's own rule (adding the trailing `"Other… (describe)"`
entry is the one permitted adjustment) already resolves which list that citer is following.

## Branch prefix undetected

`choices: ["Use `<fallback>` (default for this workflow)", "Use my initials — I'll enter them next", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used by every branch-creating orchestrator (`implement:`, `document:`, `docs-profile:`, `upgrade:`, `vuln:`) when the `_shared/branch-naming.md` §2 identity ladder — `$GIT_USER_INITIALS`, `git config user.initials`, then inference from existing branches — yields nothing. `<fallback>` is that workflow's own default (`feat/`, `docs/`, `fix/`, `chore/`).

**Identity variant.** When the value is filling an **identity** placeholder in a convention documented by the repo itself (`<your-name-or-initials>`, `<user>`, …), the fallback choice is omitted — a generic prefix is not a name, and the documented convention requires a real identity:

`"This repo's documented convention starts the branch with your name or initials, and I couldn't infer one. What should I use?"`
`choices: ["Enter my initials", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Either way, prompt for the value with: `"Enter your initials (lowercase; 2–8 characters from [a-z0-9-], starting with a letter or digit, e.g. `iv-gu` or `ivgu`):"` — then suggest, without persisting, `GIT_USER_INITIALS` or `git config --global user.initials`.

## Refresh blocked

`choices: ["Continue with current local state", "Skip this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 5 when a diff-summarizer returns `REFRESH_BLOCKED`. `create-ard:`, `design:`,
`release-notes:`, `implement:` (Phase 1.7), and `idea:` (Phase 2.6) cite this rule by name without
reproducing the list, so per the "Choice lists are presented verbatim" convention above they use this
variant — the one written under this heading.

In `epics:` Phase 5 the `"Other… (describe)"` entry is omitted:
`choices: ["Continue with current local state", "Skip this repo", "Cancel"]`

`specify:` (Phase 4) reproduces this shorter `epics:` variant inline as well. A new citer that reproduces
a list inline states which variant it uses; a citer that names the rule without reproducing the list
uses the `document:` variant above — the file's own rule (adding the trailing `"Other… (describe)"`
entry is the one permitted adjustment) already resolves which list that citer is following.

## Read-only mount — ref stale or diverged

`choices: ["Scan released code at `<ref>` (Recommended — cites shipped behavior)", "Cancel — refresh on the host (`git -C <path> fetch`) or re-mount read-write, then re-run", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used when `code-scanner` or `diff-summarizer` returns `prep.read_only: true` **and** either `prep.ref_committed_at` is more than 14 days old or `prep.head_divergence.ahead > 0`, per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/read-only-repos.md` §5. Present per affected repo. Neither agent accepts a scan-target parameter — a user who genuinely needs the unmerged working tree says so via `"Other… (describe)"`, because scanning an unmerged tree is what caused this feature's original defect: released behavior cited from unreleased code.

A read-only mount is not a failure and does not use the `Refresh blocked` list: the scan proceeds at `prep.scanned_ref`. This prompt exists only because the container cannot fetch, so refreshing the clone is an action only the user can take on the host.

The condition gates the prompt, so the `(Recommended — <why>)` reason annotation is well-formed under the rules at the top of this file.

## Review verdict BLOCK (unresolved after one fix cycle) — document:

`choices: ["Provide manual fix notes (you'll be prompted)", "Defer to a follow-up issue (record in Phase 9 report)", "Override and accept the finding", "Cancel the whole run"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 7 when `doc-reviewer` returns BLOCK a second time.
Escalate per unresolved BLOCKER individually.

## Review verdict BLOCK (unresolved after one fix cycle) — epics:

`choices: ["Provide manual fix notes (you'll be prompted)", "Defer to a follow-up issue (record in Phase 9 report)", "Override and accept the finding", "Cancel the whole run", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `epics:` Phase 7 when `epic-reviewer` returns BLOCK a second time.
Escalate per unresolved BLOCKER individually. "Defer" means the finding goes
into an Epic-refinement note in the draft itself (appended as a
`## Refinement notes` section) in addition to the Phase 9 report.
