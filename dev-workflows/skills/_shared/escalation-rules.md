# Escalation rules (shared)

Canonical `choices:` arrays for escalation decision points. Every decision
point uses a `choices:` array whose **last** entry is `"Other… (describe)"` where
applicable. Command bodies are authoritative; where `document:` and `epics:`
differ for the same scenario, both variants are listed.

## Choice lists are presented verbatim

**A choice list written into a command phase is presented to the user verbatim. Its options, their
order, their wording, and the `(Recommended)` marker are not the orchestrator's to change. An
orchestrator that believes a different option is correct for this run says so in prose alongside the
list — it never edits the list.**

This rule binds every command in the plugin, not only the ones documented below. It exists because a
`document:` run presented Phase 6.5's `["Run smoke-check (Recommended)", "Skip — use the manual table
only", "Cancel"]` with the recommendation moved onto Skip, and the render gate was never exercised.

Adding the trailing `"Other… (describe)"` entry where a phase omits it is the one permitted
adjustment.

## The `(Recommended)` marker is unconditional

**A `(Recommended)` marker applies whenever its list is shown.** A marker that carries its own
condition — `(Recommended for <case>)`, `(Recommended if <case>)` — is malformed: it hands the user
the gate the command was supposed to evaluate, and it cannot be honoured verbatim by an orchestrator
that must not edit the list. Write it one of two ways instead:

- the condition **gates the prompt** (the list is only shown in that case) → the marker is a plain
  `(Recommended)`; or
- the condition **lives in the option's own description** → the list carries no marker at all.

A **reason** annotation is not a condition and is fine: `(Recommended — <why>)` states why the option
is recommended, unconditionally, and is honoured verbatim like any other marker (`document:`
Phase 5 and `epics:` Phase 1 both use it).

When no option is safe to recommend across the runs that reach a prompt, omit the marker and say so
in prose beside the list (as `document:` Phase 5.6 does for its per-occurrence image review).

This rule binds every command in the plugin, not only the ones documented below.

## Jira key dir not found

`choices: ["Re-enter key", "Cancel"]`

Used when `jira-reader` returns `status: NOT_FOUND` or `status: EMPTY`, or when
Phase 0 of `jira-reader` rejects an invalid `jira_key` format.

## Repo unresolved (zero matches) — document:

`choices: ["Skip and continue without its PRs", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 4 when a repo slug has zero matches in the
slug→clone map.

## Repo unresolved (zero matches) — epics:

`choices: ["Skip and continue without this repo's scan", "I'll clone it — wait", "Cancel", "Specify a different absolute path for this repo", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `epics:` Phase 4 when a repo slug has zero matches in the
slug→clone map.

## No repos derivable — epics:

`choices: ["List repos to scan manually", "Proceed without code scan", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `epics:` Phase 4 when the final resolved repo list is empty (every repo
was skipped or missing — "Use case B with no repos derivable").

## Repo missing (after resolution)

`choices: ["Stash changes and retry this repo", "Skip this repo", "Cancel"]`

Used when a diff-summarizer or code-scanner batch returns `REPO_MISSING` at
Phase 5, after Phase 4 already checked. Present this choice per affected repo.

## Dirty working tree

`choices: ["Stash changes and retry this repo", "Skip this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 5 when a diff-summarizer returns `DIRTY_TREE`.

In `epics:` Phase 5 the `"Other… (describe)"` entry is omitted:
`choices: ["Stash changes and retry this repo", "Skip this repo", "Cancel"]`

## Branch prefix undetected

`choices: ["Use `<fallback>` (default for this workflow)", "Use my initials — I'll enter them next", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used by every branch-creating orchestrator (`implement:`, `document:`, `docs-profile:`, `upgrade:`, `vuln:`) when the `_shared/branch-naming.md` §2 identity ladder — `$GIT_USER_INITIALS`, `git config user.initials`, then inference from existing branches — yields nothing. `<fallback>` is that workflow's own default (`feat/`, `docs/`, `fix/`, `chore/`).

**Identity variant.** When the value is filling an **identity** placeholder in a convention documented by the repo itself (`<your-name-or-initials>`, `<user>`, …), the fallback choice is omitted — a generic prefix is not a name, and the documented convention requires a real identity:

`"This repo's documented convention starts the branch with your name or initials, and I couldn't infer one. What should I use?"`
`choices: ["Enter my initials", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Either way, prompt for the value with: `"Enter your initials (lowercase; 2–8 characters from [a-z0-9-], starting with a letter or digit, e.g. `iv-gu` or `ivgu`):"` — then suggest, without persisting, `GIT_USER_INITIALS` or `git config --global user.initials`.

## Refresh blocked

`choices: ["Continue with current local state", "Skip this repo", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 5 when a diff-summarizer returns `REFRESH_BLOCKED`.

In `epics:` Phase 5 the `"Other… (describe)"` entry is omitted:
`choices: ["Continue with current local state", "Skip this repo", "Cancel"]`

## Review verdict BLOCK (unresolved after one fix cycle) — document:

`choices: ["Provide manual fix notes (you'll be prompted)", "Defer to a follow-up issue (record in Phase 9 report)", "Override and accept the finding", "Cancel the whole run"]`

Used in `document:` Phase 7 when `doc-reviewer` returns BLOCK a second time.
Escalate per unresolved BLOCKER individually.

## Review verdict BLOCK (unresolved after one fix cycle) — epics:

`choices: ["Provide manual fix notes (you'll be prompted)", "Defer to a follow-up issue (record in Phase 9 report)", "Override and accept the finding", "Cancel the whole run", "Other… (describe)"]`

Used in `epics:` Phase 7 when `epic-reviewer` returns BLOCK a second time.
Escalate per unresolved BLOCKER individually. "Defer" means the finding goes
into an Epic-refinement note in the draft itself (appended as a
`## Refinement notes` section) in addition to the Phase 9 report.
