# Phase handoff — Shared Reference

Single source of truth for the two entry points that move a **phase deliverable** into `$SPECS_PATH`'s default branch and that refuse to start a phase whose input never got there: `handoff-to-main` (§2, producer) and `require-on-main` (§3, consumer).

**The principle.** A workflow phase is not finished until its artifact is on the default branch. A command that ends a phase commits, pushes, and opens a pull request. The command that starts the next phase does not run until the previous artifact is there. The gate applies even when the role does not change — it may be a different human of the same role, and even the same human should have to confirm the previous phase is done.

**Relationship to `specs-repo-git.md`.** That reference owns the *bookkeeping* paths (its §2.1) and the run-start/terminal steps for them. This one owns *deliverables*. It inherits four of that file's hard rules and deliberately differs on three; §1 states which.

## 1. Hard rules

Inherited from `specs-repo-git.md`, unchanged:

1. **`git -C` always; `cd` never.** Every invocation is `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" …`. Most callers are running inside a *different* repository; a `cd` would corrupt their git state. The `gh` calls in §2.6 and §3.5 name the repository with `-R` for the same reason.
2. **Bounded paths.** Only the calling command's own declared deliverable paths are staged, by enumeration (§2.3). `git add -A` is never issued at repository scope.
3. **Bounded branches.** Only branches matching `^(idea|vi|ard|spec|design|ready)/` are the plugin's (`specs-repo-git.md` §2.2).
4. **Never destructive.** No `push --force`, no `push -f`, no `branch -D`, no `merge`, no `rebase`, no `reset`, no `stash`, no `checkout --`, and never delete an `index.lock`.

Where this reference **differs** — each difference is deliberate, and a reader who "corrects" one to match `specs-repo-git.md` breaks this contract:

5. **`require-on-main` is fatal by design.** `specs-repo-git.md` §1 rule 5 is "never fatal", which is right for bookkeeping. A gate that reports and continues is not a gate. `handoff-to-main` is *not* fatal — the deliverable is already written — but it must report the phase as **not handed off**.
6. **The `Co-authored-by` trailer IS carried.** `specs-repo-git.md` §1 rule 6 forbids it because bookkeeping files are plugin-generated. A deliverable is authored content, and the existing handoff phases already carry the trailer.
7. **`handoff-to-main` runs only behind a user choice.** `specs-repo-git.md` §1 rule 7 is "prompt-free". Opening a pull request is outward-facing, so it is never reached except through the calling command's consent choice (§4.3).

## 2. `handoff-to-main` — the producer entry point

Called from a producing command's Handoff phase, and **only** when the user picked the branch-and-PR choice of §4.3.

### 2.1 Gate

All of: `$SPECS_PATH` is set and is an existing directory; `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse --git-dir` succeeds; the resolved `.git` directory is **writable**; and the run does not carry `specs_git: blocked` (`specs-repo-git.md` §3.3 G0 — a commit on a detached HEAD is reachable from no ref).

Gate fails on path / repo / permission grounds → report that the deliverable is written but not handed off, and stop. Gate fails on `specs_git: blocked` → re-emit that notice. **Never silent** — unlike the bookkeeping steps, silence here would hide the fact that the phase did not complete.

### 2.2 Branch resolution, and the collision rule

Intended name: `<prefix>/<KEY>-<slug>`, where `<prefix>` is the caller's own (§2.9) and `<KEY>-<slug>` come from **the resolved feature folder the deliverable was written into** — never re-derived from the Jira title. Folder resolution already tolerates a human-adjusted slug and a stray `-`/`_` after the key, and re-deriving would produce a branch name that disagrees with the directory it commits.

Collision is normal, not exceptional: `_readiness.md` is overwritten on every `ready:` run, and a `create-vi:` re-run after its pull request merged wants the same name again. `gh pr create` fails on an already-merged branch, and force-pushing and `branch -D` are both forbidden (§1 rule 4). So:

1. Test both `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/heads/<name>` and `… refs/remotes/origin/<name>`.
2. Neither exists → use `<name>`.
3. One exists **and** it is this run's own in-progress branch — its prefix is the caller's, its key is in the run key set (`specs-repo-git.md` §3.2), and `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" merge-base --is-ancestor refs/remotes/origin/<name> refs/remotes/origin/<default>` fails (not yet merged) → **reuse it**, switching to it rather than creating it.
4. Otherwise → append the lowest free integer suffix, starting at `-2`, retesting both refs each time. Report the substitution in the §4.1 outcome line, because a branch name the user did not expect is a branch name they will not find.

### 2.3 Staging the deliverable

Staging is by enumeration, never by glob — the same discipline as `specs-repo-git.md` §2.1, applied to a different path set:

1. `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`. `--untracked-files=all` is **required**: the default collapses an untracked directory to a single `?? dir/` line, hiding which files are staged.
2. Classify each reported path against the caller's declared deliverable paths (§2.9). Everything else is **OTHER** and is never staged — including the `dev-workflows/**` bookkeeping paths, which belong to `commit-artifacts`.
3. `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" add -A -- <path> [<path>…]` with the literal paths. `-A` is required: a producer may delete a file it relocated (`idea:` moves `idea.md` out of the vault; `update-vi:` supersedes a revision), and plain `git add` would not stage the deletion.

Nothing staged → no commit. Emit the §4.1 `nothing to commit` line. This is not an error: a re-run that changed nothing is a legitimate outcome.

### 2.4 Commit

Message `<KEY> <summary>`, matching the specs repo's own `<KEY|NOISSUE> <summary>` convention. Carry `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` (§1 rule 6).

### 2.5 Push

`git -C "$SPECS_PATH" push -u origin <branch>`. Never force. A non-fast-forward rejection is reported, never resolved by rebasing or forcing mid-run.

### 2.6 Open the pull request

Derive the repository, then call `gh` with every argument that would otherwise make it prompt — the plugin must never block on an interactive editor:

    OWNER_REPO=$(git -C "$SPECS_PATH" remote get-url origin \
      | sed -E 's#^(git@[^:]+:|https://[^/]+/)##; s#\.git$##')

    gh pr create -R "$OWNER_REPO" --base <default> --head <branch> \
                 --title "<title>" --body-file <body-path>

**Capability probe, not host classification.** Try the call; on any failure fall back to §4.2's instruction. Push authority and pull-request authority are independent — push runs over SSH with a per-repo key, `gh` runs over the API with a token, and the same account can have write access to one repository and read access to another. No hostname or host-type test can detect that mismatch, so a run can push successfully and still be unable to open the pull request. This is why `finish-and-handoff.md` §4's host classification is right for choosing *instructions* and insufficient here.

`gh` wraps the API rather than calling it over HTTPS, which is what the zero-direct-API rule permits — the same allowance `document:` already relies on.

### 2.7 Title and body

Title: the commit subject of §2.4.

Body: written to a file (never passed inline, which would break on newlines and quoting) containing what the phase produced; the artifact paths; the reviewer verdict where the caller has one; the count of open questions or `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers; and the next command in the chain together with the fact that it will not run until this pull request is merged.

### 2.8 Failure discipline

Every failure is reported and the phase is described as **not handed off**. The run is not retroactively failed — the deliverable is written and intact — but no report may imply the handoff succeeded. The next phase's gate is what enforces the consequence.

### 2.9 Caller-supplied inputs

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prefix` | one of `idea`, `vi`, `ard`, `spec`, `design`, `ready` |
| `feature_folder` | the resolved directory the deliverable was written into |
| `deliverable_paths` | the literal repo-relative paths this phase authored |
| `title` | the commit subject and pull-request title |
| `body_facts` | what §2.7 renders |

## 3. `require-on-main` — the consumer entry point

Runs in the caller's Phase 0, immediately after `specs-preflight`, so it reuses that step's best-effort `fetch` (`specs-repo-git.md` §3.2) — no second network call.

### 3.1 Gate

`$SPECS_PATH` set, an existing directory, and `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse --git-dir` succeeding. Unlike §2.1 the `.git` directory need **not** be writable — the gate only reads. A failed gate is a **silent skip** (state H): the artifacts are going to a tier the plugin does not manage, and there is nothing to verify.

### 3.2 Inputs and primitives

Inputs: the repo-relative `path` of the artifact, the `default` branch (`specs-repo-git.md` §3.2), the caller's own branch prefixes, and the run key set.

The three primitives, each verified against a real specs repo:

- **On the default branch:** `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" cat-file -e "origin/<default>:<path>" 2>/dev/null` Exit 0 = present. The `2>/dev/null` is required — on absence git writes `fatal: path '<path>' does not exist in 'origin/<default>'` to stderr, which must not leak into the run's output.
- **Worktree matches the ref:** `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" diff --quiet "origin/<default>" -- "<path>"` Exit 0 = identical. This also catches a **staged-only** change, which a `hash-object` comparison against the working file would miss.
- **Plugin branches carrying the artifact:** `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/remotes/origin` filtered to `origin/(idea|vi|ard|spec|design|ready)/*`, then `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" cat-file -e "<ref>:<path>" 2>/dev/null` on each.

### 3.3 The state table

First matching row applies.

| # | On `origin/<default>` | Worktree | HEAD | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H | — | — | gate of §3.1 fails | **silent skip** — return `unmanaged`; the caller proceeds exactly as it did before this feature |
| I | — | — | run carries `specs_git: blocked` (detached HEAD) | **stop**, re-emitting that notice. A phase cannot complete from a detached HEAD, so verifying one is meaningless |
| A | present | matches ref | any | **pass** |
| B | present | differs | a branch **this run owns**: prefix is one the caller produces, key is in the run key set | **pass, reported** — `reading <path> from your in-progress <branch>, which amends the approved version on <default>` |
| C′ | present | differs | any other HEAD, **and** the tree is dirty in a way that would block a switch | **stop**, naming the exact files |
| C | present | differs | any other HEAD | **repair offer**, then re-test once |
| D | not on ref | — | artifact found on a plugin ref, pull request open | **stop** — `<path> is on branch <branch> with PR #<n> open, not merged` |
| E | not on ref | — | found on a plugin ref, no open pull request | **stop** — `<path> is on branch <branch> and was never handed off` |
| F | not on ref | — | found on no ref | **delegate** — return `absent`; see §3.4 |
| G | `origin/<default>` ref does not exist | — | any | **stop** — the plugin cannot verify what is on `<default>` |

**`not on ref` describes the repository, not the return value.** Rows D, E, and F all read `not on ref` in the first column because none of the three has the artifact on `origin/<default>` — that column is a statement about the repository. It is row F alone that returns `absent` (§3.7), and D/E are stopping rows that never reach a caller's `absent` branch at all. A consumer that keys off this column instead of the returned `stopped` flag cannot tell D/E from F.

**Row order matters.** H and I precede everything because they are about the repository, not the artifact. C′ precedes C because offering a switch that git would refuse is worse than naming the blocker.

**Row B is load-bearing and must not be folded into C.** `design:` amends `specification.md` on its own branch, so on a resume the worktree copy legitimately differs from the default branch. Under row C the plugin would offer `switch to <default> + pull --ff-only` and **discard the in-progress design**. The distinguishing test is **branch ownership**, never whether the file differs.

**Row C's repair offer:**

    choices: ["Switch to <default> and pull --ff-only, then continue (Recommended)", "Cancel"]

On the first choice: `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" switch <default>` then `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" pull --ff-only`, then re-test **once**. A second failure stops — never merge, rebase, or reset, and never loop.

### 3.4 Row F delegates — the gate never makes an optional input mandatory

Row F is the difference between "this phase was not handed off" and "this phase never happened". Only the second is row F, and the gate has no opinion about it. Every gated input except `design:`'s `specification.md` is **optional today**, and that must not change. The gate returns `absent`; the caller does what it already does.

| Caller | Input | Pre-existing absent behaviour, preserved |
|---|---|---|
| `create-vi: <KEY>` | `idea.md` | continue down the Phase 0 idea ladder — prompt for a path, or grill the VI from scratch. **`idea:` is not a prerequisite.** |
| `create-ard:` | the VI | fall back to `jira-reader` against the Jira export — now **reported** rather than silent |
| `specify:` | the VI | `jira-reader` is already the primary read path (the merged VI is a grounding confirmation, not a new content source); on `absent` the confirmation is simply skipped — now **reported** rather than silent, the same shape as `create-ard:`'s row |
| `specify:` `design:` `implement:` `epics:` `ready:` | the ARD | `status: none` and the no-regression rule of `ard-resolution.md` |
| `epics:` | VI-level `specification.md` | `vi_spec_present: false`, the existing silent skip |
| `implement:` | `specification.md` / `design.md` | only an **in-scope** spec is gated; a direct-prompt run resolves none |
| `design:` | `specification.md` | **stops** — but that stop already exists; this reference only makes its test correct |
| `ready:` | ARD / spec / design | records the artifact as missing in its coverage roll-up, as today |

Rows D and E add the only new stop: an artifact that **exists** and was never handed off. That state is unreachable before this feature, which is why nothing regresses.

### 3.5 Locating the branch and its pull request

For rows D and E, after §3.2's ref scan finds a carrying branch:

    gh pr list -R "$OWNER_REPO" --head <branch> --state open --json number,url

`$OWNER_REPO` is derived as in §2.6. On `gh` failure, use **row E's** wording plus a note that the pull-request state could not be checked — never assert a pull request exists, and never assert one does not.

### 3.6 Degraded verification

- **Fetch failed** (offline, auth) → test against the last-known `origin/<default>` and say so, the precedent `specs-repo-git.md` §3.2 already sets: `offline — checked against the last-fetched ref`.
- **Read-only specs mount** → `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/read-only-repos.md` applies: no `fetch`, use the existing ref, emit the degraded clause. The gate still functions; only its freshness degrades.
- **No `origin/<default>` ref at all** → row G. Nothing to verify against, and proceeding silently is the failure this reference exists to prevent.

### 3.7 Return value

    on_main: pass | pass_amending | absent | unmanaged
    stopped: true | false
    branch: <the carrying plugin branch, or null>
    pr: <number, or null>
    degraded: <the clause to print, or null>

`pass_amending` is row B. `absent` is row F and is the caller's to interpret per §3.4. `unmanaged` is row H. Every stopping row returns `stopped: true` and the caller does not proceed.

**A caller tests `stopped` before `on_main`.** `on_main: absent` is returned only by row F; every stopping row (I, C′, D, E, G) returns `stopped: true` regardless of what `on_main` reads. A caller that branches on `on_main == "absent"` before checking `stopped` cannot distinguish row F (never happened — §3.4 applies) from rows D/E (happened, but not handed off — the run must stop).

## 4. Reporting

### 4.1 `handoff-to-main` outcome line

Exactly one, prefixed `Phase handoff:`.

| Case | Line |
|---|---|
| Committed, pushed, PR opened | `Phase handoff: <branch> pushed — PR #<n> open (<url>). The next phase runs once it is merged.` |
| PR not opened | `Phase handoff: <branch> pushed — PR NOT opened (<reason>). Open it manually; the next phase will stop until it is merged.` |
| Push failed | `Phase handoff: committed <sha7> on <branch> — push FAILED (<reason>). The phase is NOT handed off.` |
| Nothing to commit | `Phase handoff: no deliverable changes to commit on <branch>` |
| Branch name substituted | append `; branch name <intended> was taken, used <actual>` |
| Declined by the user | `Phase handoff: skipped at your request — <artifact> is written but not on <default>; the next phase will stop until it is.` |
| Gate failed | `Phase handoff: NOT handed off — <reason>` |

### 4.2 The no-`gh` fallback text

    The branch is pushed but no pull request was opened (<reason>).
    Open one from <branch> into <default> in the web UI, using this title:
      <title>
    The body is at <body-path>.
    Until it is merged, the next phase will stop.

### 4.3 The consent choice

Every producing command presents this array verbatim — order, wording, and the `(Recommended)` marker are not the caller's to change:

    choices: ["Branch + commit + push + open PR to main (Recommended)", "Just write the files — I'll handle git (the next phase will stop until this is on main)", "Cancel"]

The second option's parenthetical is load-bearing: it is the only place the user learns that declining has a downstream cost.

### 4.4 Stop contract

Every `require-on-main` stop carries the same four parts as `specs-repo-git.md` §5, in this order: what was found (the concrete state — the path, the branch, the pull-request number); what the plugin did **not** do, stated as the consequence; the exact commands to resolve it with `$SPECS_PATH` already substituted; and one clause on what happens if it is ignored.

## 5. Caller contract

Four obligations. Omitting any one is a defect, not a style choice.

1. A command that **produces** a `$SPECS_PATH` deliverable cites and executes `handoff-to-main` (§2) in its Handoff phase, behind §4.3's choice, and emits the §4.1 line exactly once.
2. A command that **consumes** one cites and executes `require-on-main` (§3) in its Phase 0 — before its first subagent dispatch, code scan, docs-grounding retrieval, or grill question. A gate that fires after a scan has already spent what it was meant to save.
3. A consumer acts on the returned state, and on `absent` applies its own pre-existing behaviour (§3.4). **No consumer turns an optional input into a prerequisite.**
4. **Never restate this reference's rules** — cite the section number. A rule copied into a command is a rule that goes stale.
