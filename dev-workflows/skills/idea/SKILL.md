  Idea-refinement workflow (PM phase, front of the VI-creation flow). Takes one source — an inline prompt, a markdown file (with wikilinks/images), a community post, or an exported Jira ticket (product feedback, or an existing Value Increment the idea extends, parallels, or rewrites) — and, through a bounded one-question-at-a-time grill (--deep for relentless), authors a well-refined idea.md: a lean one-page brief that seeds the future create-vi:. Writes to the vault (keyless); no Jira, no code, no specs deliverable — the only `$SPECS_PATH` writes are the run's own session artifacts, committed by `commit-artifacts`.
  Activated when the user prompt starts with "idea:".

Refine an idea into `idea.md`: the argument (text following the `idea:` trigger)

`idea:` is the **front door of the VI-creation flow** (PM phase) — upstream of `create-vi:` (future) and
the existing pipeline. It ingests one source, refines it through a grill, and writes a lean one-page
`idea.md` (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/idea-format.md`) that seeds the Value Increment. It is
**not** a VI: no Jira write, no code change, no specs-repo write. Output lands keyless in the vault;
`create-vi:` relocates it under `$SPECS_PATH` once a Jira key exists.

Flags: `--deep` switches the grill from bounded (≤5 questions) to relentless (until convergence).
`--no-docs` and `--no-prior-art` each turn off one grounding source (see Phase 1).

---

## Phase 0 — Validate environment + resolve model routing

1. **Validate `$VAULT_PATH`.** It must be **set**, an **existing directory**, and **writable** — the
   env var is the user's explicit declaration of their personal store; the plugin trusts it and does
   NOT require an Obsidian `.obsidian/` marker. If any check fails, STOP and offer:
   ```
   choices: ["Enter a directory to write idea.md into", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]
   ```
   On a user-supplied directory, validate it exists and is writable, then use it as the **write root**
   for this run. **NEVER** write into the current working directory (it may be a code repo). This is an
   environment halt, **not** a plugin-gap halt — do NOT `emit-block`.

2. **Resolve model routing.** Load and follow the model-routing policy at
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md`, then record:
   ```yaml
   model_routing:
     classification: MODERATE          # idea refinement is typically MODERATE
     reason: <one-line>
     current_model: <the model this orchestrator/grill is running under>
     detection_model: <§2.1 detection chain: claude-sonnet-4.6, fallback claude-sonnet-4.5/gpt-5.4>   # idea-reader
     authoring_model: <= current_model>   # the interactive grill + idea.md authoring (session model, not a delegated subagent)
     opus_available: <true if a §2 Opus model resolved, else false>
     notes: <any §2/§2.1 fallback or degradation>
   ```
   The grill + authoring run inline on `current_model` (the §2 Opus chain — interactive judgment, not a
   delegated subagent). `idea-reader` runs on `detection_model`. If no Opus resolves, **degrade to the
   best available and record the degradation** in `notes` and the final report — do NOT hard-block (a PM
   must not be blocked from capturing an idea by a momentary Opus outage).

**Specs-repo preflight.** Cite
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline: flush any leftover session artifacts
from an earlier run, retry an artifact commit that failed to push, and settle the branch.
Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo is clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires,
emit its §5 notice; if it returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag for the whole
run — the terminal `commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

---

## Phase 1 — Classify the source

Classify the argument (text following the `idea:` trigger) **minus every recognised flag** (`--deep`, `--no-docs`, `--no-prior-art`, and `--docs <path>` with its value) by precedence. Strip them all before classifying: an unstripped flag lands inside the `prompt` branch's raw idea text and is handed to `idea-reader` as if the user had written it.

1. Matches the Jira-key regex `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*-\d+$` → resolve it with `resolve-export-for-key <KEY>`
   (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/jira-input-resolution.md`), then type it from the export's
   **`issue_type` frontmatter** — never from the project prefix, which is a coincidence of Jira
   configuration:
   - `ValueIncrement` → **vi** — an existing VI. Prior art the user supplied.
   - `Product Need` → **rfe** — product feedback, handled as demand evidence exactly as today.
   - anything else → name the actual `issue_type` in the confirmation below and let the user choose;
     **default vi**, since a tracked delivery item is closer to prior art than to demand evidence.

   `NOT_FOUND` from the entry point is handled as today (an environment/user halt, never `emit-block`).
2. An existing `.md` path or an `@wikilink` → **markdown** (a community post is just a markdown file,
   typically under `Projects/Products/…` — the reader tags it `community-post`; an existing `idea.md`
   passed back for re-refinement is detected here too).
3. Otherwise → **prompt** (the argument text is the raw idea).

Surface a one-line confirmation before ingesting:
```
choices: ["Read this as <detected-type> (Recommended)", "It's actually a <other-type>", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]
```
(A dedicated `--as prompt|markdown|rfe|vi` override is future work — the confirmation covers a mis-detection.)

Show the `docs grounding:` line in the form `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/docs-grounding.md` resolved — `ON <root> (retrieval: …)` or `OFF (<reason>)` — verbatim, including any index-build, staleness, or shadowing clause it carries (off switch: --no-docs).

Show the `prior art:` line in the form `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/vault-prior-art.md` resolved — `ON <vault-root>` or `OFF (<reason>)` — verbatim (off switch: --no-prior-art). Run `resolve-prior-art idea` per that reference to obtain it; it runs exactly once per run.

---

## Phase 2 — Ingest the source (idea-reader)

Dispatch `idea-reader` to read the source and return a structured digest:

→ task(agent_type: "dev-workflows:idea-reader", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
  > "Ingest this idea source and return the structured digest:
  >
  > argument:        [the resolved argument]
  > provenance_hint: [prompt | markdown | community-post | rfe | vi from Phase 1]
  > vault_path:      [resolved $VAULT_PATH]"

Wait for the digest. If `status: NOT_FOUND` (invalid key / missing file), surface:
```
choices: ["Re-enter the source", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]
```
This is an environment/user halt — do NOT `emit-block`. On `OK`, carry forward `raw_context`,
`signals`, `images`, `candidate_title`, `candidate_slug`, `source_refs`, `provenance`, `tracked` (a
`vi` source only), and the followed/broken wikilinks — `source_refs`/`provenance` feed the `sources:`
frontmatter entry in Phase 4, and `tracked` seeds `## Prior art`.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Grounding: documentation + vault prior art (optional)

Dispatch both grounding agents **in a single response** so they run in parallel. Each is independent; either being OFF never suppresses the other.

**Docs.** Run `resolve-docs-grounding idea` per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/docs-grounding.md`. When `docs_grounding: ON`, `dispatch-docs-grounder` with `feature_summary` = the `idea-reader` digest's problem/outcome, `themes` = its signals; **omit `jira_key`** (idea is keyless, so the git-grep backstop is skipped). When OFF, skip silently.

**Prior art.** Using the `resolve-prior-art idea` result already obtained in Phase 1: when `prior_art: ON`, `dispatch-prior-art-finder` per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/vault-prior-art.md` with `feature_summary` = the same problem/outcome, `themes` = the digest's signals, and `known_refs` built from the reader's digest: every `wikilinks_followed` path and every filesystem-path `source_refs` ref as `{path, has_summary: true}` (`idea-reader` already summarised them), plus — for a `vi` source — `{jira_key: <KEY>, has_summary: true}`. Passing the key rather than a path is deliberate: the orchestrator does not know which vault directory holds that VI, and resolving it is the finder's job. The supplied VI is then classified and status-resolved by the same code path as a discovered one. When OFF, skip silently.

Carry both digests into Phase 3 with **grill-rank** consumption — challenges from the two compete together for the ≤5 question slots, they do not add slots. Carry `area_proposal` and the `vi` source's match into Phase 4.

---

## Phase 3 — Refine via grill

**Interview technique (grilling — embedded; no runtime dependency).** Follow the shared technique in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/grilling-technique.md` — one question at a time, recommend each answer, fact-vs-decision split (look up facts from the `idea-reader` digest / vault, put only decisions to the user), walk the design tree in dependency order. **Depth: bounded by default (below); `--deep` = relentless.**

Scan for gaps against an idea-stage **ambiguity taxonomy**: *problem clarity, target users, desired
outcome/value, scope boundaries, evidence/demand sufficiency, success signal, terminology.* Rank gaps by **Impact × Uncertainty**, ranking every `docs_challenges` and `prior_art_challenges` entry from Phase 2.5 into that same list. Challenges **compete** for the slots below; they never add slots.

- **Default (bounded):** ask **≤5** questions across the ranked gaps, then stop. Remaining high-impact
  gaps become `- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]` in the `idea.md` **Open questions & assumptions**
  section, **capped at 3**; reasonable defaults are recorded as `- **Assumption:** <text>`.
- **`--deep`:** relentless — keep walking the design tree one question at a time until you and the user
  reach shared understanding; the cap does not apply.

---

## Phase 4 — Write idea.md

Author `idea.md` per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/idea-format.md` into the write root resolved in
Phase 0, applying the no-hard-wrap prose convention in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/prose-formatting.md`:

- **Path (container default):** `<container(source path)>/<candidate_slug>/idea.md`, where the container
  is derived per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/vault-prior-art.md`. A source already sitting under a
  `Projects/Products/` grouper lands beside its neighbours in that grouper; an inline prompt, a Jira key
  with no vault item, and any source outside `Projects/Products/` all resolve to `Projects/ideas/`
  exactly as before.
- **Write-path gate.** Assemble **one** `choices:` array, in this row order, and present it verbatim:

  | Row | Included when | Text |
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | `provenance: vi` | `Rewrite <KEY> — reuse its Jira key; write into <item-dir>/` when the finder resolved one, else `Rewrite <KEY> — reuse its Jira key; write to <container default>/<candidate_slug>/` |
  | 2 | `area_proposal.path` non-null, `confidence: high`, **and** it differs from the container default | `New idea under <area_proposal.path>/<candidate_slug>/` |
  | 3 | always | `New idea — a new Jira key will be minted; write to <container default>/<candidate_slug>/ as detected` |
  | 4 | always | `Enter a different path` |
  | 5 | always | `Cancel` |
  | 6 | always | `Other… (describe)` |

  The gate **fires only when at least one of rows 1–2 is present**; otherwise the container default
  applies silently. Append `(Recommended)` to **exactly one** row, chosen by the **top match** — the
  `prior_art` entry with the highest `match_confidence`, ties broken by array order — and its
  `relation`: `supersedes_self` → row 1 **when present, else row 3**; every other relation → row 2
  when present, else row 3. `supersedes_self` needs its own fallback because it is reachable for **any**
  `known_refs` entry — a `markdown` source that wikilinks a VI work document can carry it — while row 1
  ships only for `provenance: vi`.
  **When there is no top match at all — prior-art grounding OFF, an invalid `$VAULT_PATH`, a non-vault
  write root, or the finder returning `EMPTY` — recommend row 3.** That state is reachable precisely
  because row 1 fires on `provenance: vi` alone, and nothing is then known about whether this is a
  rewrite; the neutral default is the one that mints no Jira key. Every branch must name a row that is
  actually in the array, or the gate renders with nothing marked. Never recommend row 1 without
  `supersedes_self` — extending and paralleling a VI are as common as rewriting one, and a wrong
  default here silently mints or fails to mint a Jira key. Validate every chosen path sits inside the
  resolved write root and is writable.

  Record the choice as **`vi_disposition`** — `rewrite` for row 1, `new` for every other row — and carry
  it into Phase 5. **When the gate does not fire at all, `vi_disposition` is `new`.** Row 1 keys only on
  `provenance: vi`, never on the finder resolving anything, so a `vi` source always reaches this question
  even when prior-art grounding is OFF or the key has no vault work document — the disposition decides
  whether the user is told to mint a Jira key, which is not an advisory matter and must not depend on an
  advisory, user-disableable subsystem. This is the only point in the flow where the three shapes of a supplied VI (extend,
  parallel, rewrite-in-place) can be told apart.
- **`## Prior art`:** write the section per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/idea-format.md` when
  Phase 2.5 returned any `prior_art` entry **or** the source is `vi`; omit it entirely otherwise. A `vi`
  source contributes its Phase 2 `tracked` block (key, status, summary) even when prior-art grounding is
  OFF — it is prior art the user handed over, not something the finder discovered — and appears there
  **and** in `sources:`. Merge by Jira key so a supplied VI the finder also matched yields one bullet: the finder's entry wins,
  because it is a strict superset of `tracked` (it adds `relation`, `match_reason`, and a vault path). A
  finder match with `jira_key: null` cannot collide — a supplied VI always has a key.
- **Existing file:** if `idea.md` already exists at that path, offer:
  ```
  choices: ["Refine the existing idea.md (Recommended)", "Create a new one (you'll be prompted for a slug)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]
  ```
  On *refine*, re-open it, resolve its open `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items, and append the new source to
  `sources`.
- **`status`:** set frontmatter `status: refined` IFF zero `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain;
  otherwise `status: draft`.

---

## Phase 5 — Handoff: adaptive next-phase offer

Report where `idea.md` was written and its `status`, then offer the next phase — **adapted to status**:

- **`refined`, `vi_disposition: new`** (and every run with no `vi` source): *"Idea refined. Next: create
  the VI — first create an empty Jira workitem, then run `create-vi: <JIRA-KEY> @<idea.md
  path>`."*
- **`refined`, `vi_disposition: rewrite`:** *"Idea refined. Next: `create-vi: <KEY>
  @<idea.md path>` — this rewrites the existing VI, so no new Jira workitem is needed. If an authored VI
  already exists for `<KEY>`, `create-vi:` will redirect you to `update-vi: <KEY>`."*
- **`draft`** (N open clarifications): *"This idea has N open clarification(s). You can (a) run
  `idea: @<idea.md path> --deep` to resolve them, or (b) proceed to
  `create-vi: <KEY-or-JIRA-KEY> @<idea.md path>`, which will grill you on the rest."* Use
  the same `vi_disposition` clause as above when a `vi` source was given.

Also report any prior art found — matched keys with their statuses, and the alternative container path
when one exists — **whether or not the gate fired**, so the user can relocate before `create-vi:` makes
the path sticky.

`create-vi:` is a separate command; this offer is guidance the user acts on — it never auto-invokes
another command. (Per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md` — the plugin-wide
next-phase-offer contract; `idea:` is one reference implementation.)

### Context hygiene

Continuing to `create-vi:` (still the PM phase)? → run **`/compact`** to free context; your
`idea.md` is already on disk. (No resume pointer or `/rename` label here — the VI-Key is
minted later, and the ideation phase is short.) Guidance only — see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md`.

---

## Phase 6 — Session maintenance & feedback

Terminal phase — runs after Phase 5, NEVER interrupts an earlier phase.

**Capture-at-block invariant.** If an EARLIER phase **halts on a plugin / skill / command / reference
gap** (a capability the run needed but the plugin lacked), `emit-block` (per
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md`) at that halt **before** escalating — so a run
abandoned at the block still records the gap. NEVER `emit-block` for an environment / user halt (bad
`$VAULT_PATH`, source-not-found, cancellation).

**Session-hygiene invariant.** End Phase 5 with a `### Context hygiene` note per
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md` — a same-role `/compact` suggestion
(no `resume.md`, no `/rename`: pre-VI, short PM phase). Guidance only, never auto-run.

1. **Invoke `impl-maintenance`** (agent_type: "dev-workflows:impl-maintenance", model: `<detection_model — §2.1 detection chain>`):
   > "Analyse this session and return a Lessons Learned report.
   >
   > Session handoff:
   > - Command run: idea:
   > - What was done: [one-paragraph summary of the idea refined + source type]
   > - Key events: [source-detection corrections, unresolved clarifications, broken wikilinks — or 'none']
   > - Workarounds used: [manual steps not automated by the workflow — or 'none']
   > - Review verdict: N/A (no reviewer in idea:)
   > - Test result: N/A (no tests in idea:)
   > - Project root: [the idea.md folder]"
2. **Persist plugin feedback (automatic).** Cite
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and call its `emit-auto` entry point (§6)
   with the Lessons Learned report, `command: idea:`, `jira_key: null`, the run's `source`, and
   `plugin_version` (read from `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/.plugin/plugin.json`). It renders only the
   plugin-facing slice (§4), dedupes by stable `id` (§3), resolves the target via the §2 specs-first
   ladder, and writes silently. Surface the persisted path (or "no plugin-facing signal — nothing
   persisted").
3. **Commit session artifacts (terminal).** Cite
   `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
   and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline — the LAST action of the run. It stages
   ONLY the §2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
   `NOISSUE Add dev-workflows session artifacts (idea:)` (this run is keyless — no VI-Key exists
   yet), and pushes. It NEVER touches a code/docs repo, the vault, or the current working directory;
   NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the run; and skips entirely when the run carries
   `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting that notice. Hold its §6 outcome line for the Final
   report. No `resume.md` is written for `idea:`
   (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/session-hygiene.md`
   §1 skip list — pre-VI and keyless).

ADDITIVE — this phase NEVER fails the run, NEVER commits the deliverable (idea.md carries no git offer
of its own — the terminal step above commits only the bounded session-artifact paths in `$SPECS_PATH`),
and NEVER writes into a code/docs repo or the current working directory; no user name is ever written.

---

## Final report

Report: the `idea.md` path + `status` (refined / draft with N open clarifications); the source type and
`sources`; the count of `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` items and Assumptions; any source-detection correction
or broken wikilinks; the resolved model routing (+ any Opus degradation); the feedback path; the
`Specs repo:` outcome line from `commit-artifacts`
(`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md` §6),
with any guard notice repeated in full; any prior art found (keys + statuses), any `status_conflict` a
match reported (both values and the export's date — it is the signal that catches a broken sync) and any
`notes` the finder returned; the resolved `vi_disposition`; and the adaptive next-phase recommendation.
