Log a corrective interaction and act on it: the argument (text following the `prompt:` trigger)

`prompt:` is for when a dev-workflows command (`specify:`, `design:`,
`implement:`, `document:`, …) produced something wrong and you want to correct
it directly. It captures the **corrective triple** as plugin feedback, then
performs the correction. `origin: prompt`.

Captured (per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` §1):
1. **Friction** — what the command produced that was wrong.
2. **User prompt** — your corrective request, **verbatim** (the `prompt:` argument).
3. **Resolution** — what the AI actually did.

---

## Phase 0 — Specs-repo preflight

Cite `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
and execute its `specs-preflight` entry point (§3) inline: flush any leftover
session artifacts from an earlier run, retry an artifact commit that failed to
push, and settle the branch. This runs against `$SPECS_PATH` only —
`git -C "$SPECS_PATH"`, never a `cd`, so whatever repository you are standing
in is untouched (§1 rule 1). Prompt-free and silent when the specs repo is
clean and on its default branch. If a guard fires, emit its §5 notice; if it
returns `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), carry that flag — the terminal
`commit-artifacts` step skips on it.

---

## Phase 1 — Identify the target

Infer the target command from recent context — which command's output you are
correcting. Ask only if genuinely ambiguous (one grouped prompt, last choice
`"Other… (describe)"`). If no command applies, use `n/a`.

## Phase 2 — Act on the correction

Perform the corrective request in the `prompt:` argument directly (the quick correction).
Keep a one-line summary of what you did — this becomes the **Resolution** block.

## Phase 3 — Persist the corrective triple

Cite `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/feedback-emission.md` and call its
`emit-prompt` entry point (§6). Provide:
- **Friction** — what the command produced that was wrong.
- **User prompt** — the `prompt:` argument, **verbatim** (never paraphrased).
- **Resolution** — the one-line summary of the correction you just applied.
- `command` (Phase 1), an inferred `category` (§1 vocab, reuse-first), `impact`,
  `jira_key` (or `null`), `source`.

`emit-prompt` resolves the write target via the §2 specs-first ladder, formats
the entry with the two extra prose blocks (`origin: prompt`), and appends per §3
(prompt entries are never silently skipped). Write silently — a single append.

**Then commit session artifacts (terminal).** Cite
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md`
and execute its `commit-artifacts` entry point (§4) inline. It stages ONLY the
§2.1 bounded artifact paths inside `$SPECS_PATH`, commits
`<KEY> Add dev-workflows session artifacts (prompt:)` — or `NOISSUE …` when no
`jira_key` resolved — and pushes. It NEVER touches a code/docs repo, the vault,
or the current working directory; NEVER force-pushes; NEVER fails the run; and
skips entirely when the run carries `specs_git: blocked` (§3.3 G0), re-emitting
that notice. Hold its §6 outcome line for Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Report

Surface the persisted path and any degradation notice, then the `Specs repo:`
outcome line from `commit-artifacts`
(`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md` §6),
with any guard notice repeated in full.

This command NEVER commits into a docs/code repo, the vault, or the current
working directory — only the correction itself edits your target files, as you
requested, and those edits are never staged. The terminal `commit-artifacts`
step commits ONLY `$SPECS_PATH`'s bounded artifact paths
(`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/specs-repo-git.md` §2.1).
