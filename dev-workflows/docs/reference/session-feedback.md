# Session feedback

Session feedback captures two different signals about **the dev-workflows plugin itself** — what you report, and what your corrections reveal — never about the target project you happened to be working in, and persists them per-VI into the specs repo, so the plugin maintainer can aggregate what went wrong or felt awkward across every engineer who used it. It shares its per-VI home, `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/`, with the follow-up files described elsewhere in this reference section, but is otherwise a separate mechanism: no dedup *between the two subsystems*, no cross-reference, and its own file per VI rather than per session.

## What gets logged, and by what

Two capture paths feed the same file, distinguished by their `origin`:

- **Automatic (`origin: auto`)** — every one of the thirteen workflow skills' post-run maintenance phase (the fourteen `model-routing` pipeline skills minus `docs-profile:`, which has no such phase) reuses the existing `impl-maintenance` agent's Lessons Learned report and projects the plugin-facing slice out of it: command workflow improvements, new agents or skills the plugin should offer, and gaps in the plugin's own reference docs, plus the key observations that triggered them. Target-project advice — `copilot-instructions.md` rule suggestions, hooks for the repo you're working in — is deliberately discarded here; that stays in the in-session maintenance report, since it is for your current repo, not the plugin maintainer. A routine session with nothing plugin-facing to report writes nothing at all — no empty entry, byte-identical to a run where this phase did not exist. There is also a narrower automatic case, `emit-block`, used when a run halts because the plugin itself lacked something it needed (a missing capability, a missing reference doc) — it logs one `origin: auto`, `impact: blocker` entry directly, since no full maintenance report exists yet on an abandoned mid-flight run.
- **User-invoked, four skills.** `feedback: <text>` logs a manual note about the plugin, tied to no other skill, with `origin: manual`. `prompt:`, `prompt-brainstorm:`, and `prompt-grill-me:` each capture a corrective interaction — a skill produced something wrong and you fixed it — with `origin: prompt`, and act on the correction their own way. `prompt:` is the one that acts first — its Phase 2 applies the fix, and Phase 3 persists the record of it. The other two log first, then act: `prompt-brainstorm:` persists the record at Phase 2, then hands off to `superpowers:brainstorming` to redesign it together at Phase 3; `prompt-grill-me:` persists the record at Phase 2, then interrogates the fix inline with a bounded grill at Phase 3.

### Why `prompt:*` is the more valuable of the two

`feedback:` and `prompt:*` are not two spellings of the same thing, and the difference is worth understanding before you pick one.

`feedback:` records **what you say about the plugin** — a judgement, in your words, at a moment when something annoyed you. Useful, but it is a report of a problem.

`prompt:*` records **what you did about a bad result**. When a skill produces something you are not happy with and you correct it through one of these skills, the entry captures the whole path: the unsatisfactory output, every correction you made, and the output you settled on. That triple — *bad result → the corrections → good result* — is far more actionable than a complaint, because it does not just say the skill got it wrong; it demonstrates what right looks like and the reasoning that got there. Aggregated across many runs, those paths are the raw material for improving the skill itself: a correction you had to make by hand three times is a rule the skill should have applied on its own.

**So correct through `prompt:*`, not through a plain prompt.** If you simply reply in the session and talk the model into a better answer, you get the better answer and nothing else. Routing the same correction through `prompt:`, `prompt-brainstorm:`, or `prompt-grill-me:` gets you the same fixed output **and** a durable, structured record of how you got there — committed and pushed alongside the run's other artifacts, where it can actually be aggregated. The three differ only in how much help you want while fixing it — `prompt:` applies the fix directly, `prompt-brainstorm:` hands off to `superpowers:brainstorming` to redesign it with you, `prompt-grill-me:` interrogates the fix with a bounded grill. Unlike the Claude edition, this edition attaches no cost report to any of the four — it has no cost subsystem at all.

**`origin: manual` and `origin: prompt` entries are never silently skipped.** Because you invoked one of these four skills, the invocation itself is the signal of intent — unlike the automatic path, there is no "nothing to report" outcome. If a new entry's `id` happens to collide with an existing one, it is appended anyway with a numeric suffix rather than dropped, and a near-identical collision is flagged with a warning. Automatic entries behave the opposite way: before appending an `origin: auto` entry, the existing `id:` values in the file are checked, and a match is skipped as `SKIP — already logged` — because `id` is built from a stable `<KEY>-<command>-<short-slug>` shape, re-running a pipeline never double-logs the same automatic signal twice.

None of this pauses the run for approval. Capture is silent and high-recall by design — curation is the maintainer's job centrally, at analysis time, not something to ask a non-expert engineer to triage mid-run, where the honest risk is that they would either rubber-stamp everything or drop exactly the signal the maintainer needed.

## Where files land

The primary target is `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/<KEY>-feedback.md` — one file per VI: walk down a ladder and stop at the first tier that applies. `$SPECS_PATH` writable with the VI directory matched is the primary case; `$SPECS_PATH` writable but no VI directory found writes to `$SPECS_PATH/dev-workflows-feedback/<KEY-or-date>.md` at the specs-repo root instead, marked unfiled so it can be moved under the right VI dir later; no `$SPECS_PATH` but a writable vault falls back to `$VAULT_PATH/dev-workflows/feedback/<KEY>-feedback.md` with a loud warning that it will not auto-aggregate to the maintainer; an imported Jira directory with neither available writes beside that directory; and if nothing resolves at all, the entry stays in the run's own printed output and is never written into your current working directory, since that may be a code repository. In every non-primary tier the entry also stays visible in the run's final output, so nothing is silently lost even when it can't be filed where it belongs.

**Committing and pushing this file alongside your specs is expected and encouraged, not clutter.** Feedback only reaches the maintainer once it lands in the committed, pushed specs repo, so every skill's terminal step commits and pushes it as a matter of course — team-visible feedback across engineers is the entire point of this feature.

## Entry format

One file per VI, `<KEY>-feedback.md`, opening with frontmatter written once on creation:

```yaml
---
type: dev-workflows-feedback
vi: PRODUCT-14902
slug: env-ag-update-window
---
```

Each logged entry is a dated heading, a fenced YAML block, and prose — appended chronologically, never modified or deleted once written:

````markdown
## 2026-07-09 — document: — missing-capability

```yaml
id: PRODUCT-14902-document-saas-managed-split
date: 2026-07-09
command: document:            # controlled: exact skill name, or n/a
plugin_version: 2.9.0
origin: auto                 # auto | manual | prompt
author: you@example.com
category: missing-capability # controlled, extensible, reuse-first
impact: friction             # blocker | friction | polish
```

**Friction:** One page covered both SaaS and Managed; the SaaS half got pushed
back in review because the two products differ here.

**Suggested improvement:** Add an optional `saas|managed` parameter to
`document:` so the run scopes to one product.
````

`category` is a controlled but extensible vocabulary — reuse an existing value when it fits rather than minting a near-duplicate, so signals cluster instead of fragmenting: `missing-capability`, `wrong-output`, `ambiguous-prompt`, `missing-reference-doc`, `model-routing`, `manual-workaround`, `false-positive`, `docs-ux`, `other`. `impact` is `blocker`, `friction`, or `polish`. `author` comes from `git config user.email` in the specs repo, best-effort, `unknown` if it can't be resolved — the git commit author is the second, authoritative identity layer once the entry is actually committed and pushed. An `origin: prompt` entry carries two additional prose blocks after Friction and Suggested improvement: **User prompt** (your corrective request, verbatim) and **Resolution** (what the AI actually did in response).
