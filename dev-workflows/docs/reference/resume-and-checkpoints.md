# Resume and checkpoints

A long-running skill ends by doing two separate things: it flushes a small pointer file to disk recording exactly where things stand, then it suggests — never performs — the right context action for what comes next, `/compact`, `/clear`, or a session `/rename`. Both are guidance only; the plugin never invokes any of those three itself. The point is to stop relying on you to remember to ask "am I ready to compact or clear" — the pipeline does the disk-flush itself and hands you the choice already framed.

## What `resume.md` is for

`resume.md` exists so you can pick a run back up in a fresh session without re-deriving what the last one already established — what skill ran last, what it produced, and what to run next — instead of scrolling back through a compacted or cleared transcript, or worse, re-reading every artifact from scratch to reconstruct where you left off. It is a **"last known position" pointer, overwritten every run, not an append log** — there is exactly one current answer to "where am I," not a history of every past one. It stays intentionally tiny:

```markdown
# Resume — <KEY>[ / <EPIC-KEY>] (<role>)

- **Last completed:** <skill> <args> — <phase or 'skill complete'> (<ISO datetime>)
- **Artifact:** <relative path to the deliverable just written/committed, or 'none (read-only)'>
- **Next step:** <the exact next skill from ### Next step, or 'VI fully processed'>
- **Suggested session name:** <VI-ID>-<slug>-<role>   (omit this line when no VI-Key exists yet — e.g. create-vi:)
- **Carry-forward decisions:** <0–N one-line decisions the next phase needs that are NOT already in the artifact; 'none' if none>
```

Any secret, credential, token, or other sensitive value that might otherwise land in the `Carry-forward decisions` line is redacted before writing — a resume pointer records what to do next, never a value worth protecting.

**When it's written.** The write is unconditional for any VI-scoped run, and it happens as its own terminal step — after the deliverable artifact is already saved or committed, after the terminal feedback and follow-up steps have run, and before the terminal `commit-artifacts` step. That ordering matters: several skills compose their printed Final Report before their feedback and follow-up phases even run, so tying the write to the printed report would land it before the follow-up entry it's supposed to follow, and it would never get committed, since `commit-artifacts` itself runs after the feedback and follow-up steps. The canonical terminal order is deliverable and handoff, then feedback, then follow-ups, then `resume.md`, then `commit-artifacts`. Whether the suggestion (below) actually fires or not, the write itself always happens — **prepare always, suggest adaptively.**

**Where it lands.** Four tiers, walked in order: `$SPECS_PATH` writable with the VI directory matched → `<VI-dir>/dev-workflows/resume.md`, the primary case; `$SPECS_PATH` writable but **no VI directory matched** → the file is skipped outright and the run relies on the printed `### Next step` instead — this tier does **not** fall back to the vault; no `$SPECS_PATH` at all, but `$VAULT_PATH` writable → `$VAULT_PATH/dev-workflows/resume/<KEY>-resume.md`; and neither writable → skipped, with a one-line warning that no resume pointer could be persisted and you should set one of the two variables.

**Which runs skip it entirely.** A run with no VI to anchor the pointer to writes none: `idea:` (pre-VI, keyless), `implement:` in direct mode, `document:`'s doc-edit mode, and `vuln:` and `upgrade:` (their durable state is the branch or PR already on disk, not a VI-scoped artifact).

## The suggestion: `/compact` or `/clear`

Every next-step option a skill offers already carries a role label — see [Roles](../roles.md) for what PM, PA, PE, and Dev each own; the mechanism that reads those labels itself calls the fourth role **Team** rather than Dev (`skills/_shared/next-phase-offer.md` heads its own build section "Team/Dev — build"), so this page follows that spelling. The context-hygiene suggestion reads those same role labels rather than hardcoding a per-skill verdict:

- **Staying in the same role** for the next step (`design: E1` → `design: E2`, Team→Team) → **`/compact`** — the context is still relevant, so keep the thread going.
- **Moving to a different role** (`epics:` PE → `design:` Team) → **`/clear`** is the better default when one person is wearing both hats, since the prior role's reasoning becomes noise for the next one; `/compact` still works fine if you're continuing right away yourself.
- **The next step could go either way** (`create-vi:` → PM `release-notes:`, or handing off to PA/PE) → both branches are named explicitly: continuing as the same role suggests `/compact`, handing off — even to yourself — suggests `/clear`.
- **You're done, or ending the session** → no suggestion at all.

## Mid-phase checkpoints and big non-pipeline commands

A run doesn't have to finish to earn a checkpoint. `implement:`'s own mid-phase checkpoint (Scope-to-N, or per-Epic) suggests `/compact` to free up budget before continuing — never `/clear` here, since a mid-command checkpoint is never a role transition. `vuln:` and `upgrade:` are large, non-pipeline skills with no role transition of their own: each gets a plain end-of-run `/compact` suggestion near its maintenance handoff, and neither writes a `resume.md`, since their durable state already lives in the branch or PR they produced.

## The `/rename` aid

Within this rename-aid set, a VI key is first available at `release-notes:`, and every PA/PE/Team skill that takes a `<VI>` argument (`create-ard:`, `epics:`, `specify:`, `design:`, `ready:`, `implement:`, `document:`, `release-notes:`) prints a suggested `/rename <VI-ID>-<slug>-<role>` line, so you can find this session again later by name instead of by scrolling. `<role>` is the lane tag of the skill that just finished — pm, pa, pe, or team. `idea:` and `create-vi:` are excluded from this aid: idea refinement is short, it usually runs before the paste-into-Jira-and-reimport round trip that mints the VI key in the first place, so there is often no key yet to name the session after — and on the rarer runs that do carry one already, the phase is still short enough that naming the session isn't worth automatically suggesting.

## The contract

Five rules bound everything above: it is **guidance-only** — `/compact`, `/clear`, and `/rename` are always suggested, never invoked by the plugin itself; the disk flush is **prepare-first** — unconditional for a VI-scoped run and always ahead of the suggestion it accompanies, so acting on the printed suggestion is always safe; the compact-versus-clear split is **role-aware through a single graph**, reading role labels from the next-step offer rather than duplicating that graph here; the whole mechanism is **mode-aware**, degrading to a plain optional `/compact` note (or nothing at all) on a direct, doc-edit, non-pipeline, or pre-VI run with no VI anchor to write a pointer against; and it **never blocks** — the guidance is a nudge appended to the end of the Final Report, exactly like the next-phase offer it sits beside.
