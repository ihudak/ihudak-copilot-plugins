# Environment reference

[Getting started](../getting-started.md) says what each variable is *for* and what to export before your first run. This page says what each variable **is** — its default, where that default comes from, what happens when it is unset, what happens when it points somewhere the plugin cannot read or write, and the directory layout it expects underneath it. The plugin reads 5 user-settable variables. The rest of the names the plugin's own inventory check encounters while scanning for `$VAR` reads are never user-settable and stay out of scope here — and, unlike the Claude edition, neither of the two that might look like configuration is: `MODEL_ROUTING` is a **hook-local shell variable** assigned inside `hooks/preload-context.sh:52` (it just points at the bundled `model-routing.md` path for that hook invocation, and nothing outside the hook script ever reads it), and `PLUGIN_ROOT` is **host-injected** — the Copilot CLI equivalent of Claude Code's `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, set by the host for every plugin invocation, never by you. `OSTYPE`, `BASH_SOURCE`, `BASH_REMATCH`, `ROOT`, and `OWNER_REPO` are shell built-ins or internal template/hook-local names for the same reason. This edition reads no `$ARGUMENTS` variable at all.

## `$SPECS_PATH`

- **`$SPECS_PATH`** — the shared, team-visible repository every authoring skill lands its artifact in; required, with no built-in default.

**Resolution.** Read straight from the shell environment — there is no config file, CLI flag, or derived fallback that feeds it. Every skill that writes into it validates it at its own gating step (Phase 0 in most skills, Step 0 in `vuln:`) before doing any expensive work.

**When unset.** The six skills that gate on it — `create-vi:`, `update-vi:`, `create-ard:`, `specify:`, `design:`, `ready:` — stop immediately, name `SPECS_PATH` explicitly, and offer `choices: ["Set SPECS_PATH (enter the path)", "Cancel"]`. `epics:` and `release-notes:` instead degrade: `epics:` skips the artifact steps that need it, and `release-notes:` falls back to `run_phase: pm`. No skill silently substitutes the vault, the current working directory, or any other path.

**When it points somewhere unreadable.** Two separate gates apply, and they differ in strictness. The bookkeeping entry point, `specs-preflight`, requires `$SPECS_PATH` to be an existing directory, `git -C "$SPECS_PATH" rev-parse --git-dir` to succeed, **and** the resolved `.git` directory to be **writable** (tested specifically rather than the worktree, since a read-only specs mount is a normal state in this container setup); a failed gate is a silent no-op, and because the terminal `commit-artifacts` step applies the same writability gate, the feedback/follow-up bookkeeping never gets committed either — `specs-preflight` only declines to prepare for a commit that step would then decline to make. The deliverable-verification entry point, `require-on-main`, needs only the first two conditions — a **readable** git dir is enough, writability is not required, since this gate only reads; a failed gate here returns the state `unmanaged`, and the caller proceeds exactly as it did before this handoff machinery existed — no artifact is verified, and nothing is reported as a stop. [Roles](../roles.md) covers the two states you meet more often mid-pipeline — an artifact stuck on an unmerged branch, and one that is simply absent from the default branch — but not `unmanaged`, since that is this environment condition (an unset or unmanageable `$SPECS_PATH`), not a workflow state.

**Directory layout.** See the layout block at the end of this page.

## `$VAULT_PATH`

- **`$VAULT_PATH`** — your personal, markdown-backed store; required for `idea:` and for any skill resolving `jira-products/<KEY>/`, with no built-in default.

**Resolution.** Read straight from the shell environment, exactly like `$SPECS_PATH` — no derived fallback exists.

**When unset.** Behavior depends on the skill. `idea:` validates it must be set, an existing directory, and writable before doing anything else; if any of that fails it stops and offers a choice to enter a different directory to write `idea.md` into, or cancel — a user-supplied directory is validated the same way and used as the write root for that run — it never falls back to the current working directory, since that may be a code repository. Jira-driven skills that accept an already-imported export directory as their input (`epics:`, `release-notes:`) degrade gracefully instead: with `$VAULT_PATH` unset, `epics:` writes Epic drafts to a derived `epic-drafts/<jira_key>/` directory beside the import rather than under `jira-drafts/<VI-KEY>/`, and `release-notes:` resolves its draft destination the same way.

**When it points somewhere unreadable.** The same validation that catches "unset" catches "exists but not writable" — both trip the same stop-and-offer path in `idea:`; a skill with the graceful-degradation behavior above treats an invalid `$VAULT_PATH` the same way it treats an unset one.

**Directory layout.** See the layout block at the end of this page.

## `$REPOS_PATH`

- **`$REPOS_PATH`** — where your code clones live; defaults to `/workspace` when unset.

**Resolution.** `${REPOS_PATH:-/workspace}`, read fresh by each skill that scans code — there is no persisted override once a run ends. It may be a single directory or a colon-separated list, and every repo-scanning skill that offers a choice presents the resolved default first: `choices: ["Use $REPOS_PATH (default /workspace) (Recommended)", "Use a different path (you'll be prompted)", "Cancel", "Other… (describe)"]`. Where a skill resolves a repo from a pull-request URL — `document:`, `epics:`, `release-notes:` — the match is by `git remote get-url origin` slug, **never by directory name**, so a clone renamed on disk is still found as long as its `origin` remote is intact. The skills that instead discover repos to offer you (`idea:`, `create-ard:`, `design:`) list the top-level directories under each entry and match on their basenames, attaching the slug afterwards as identity.

**When unset.** The `/workspace` default takes over silently — this is deliberately safe because `$REPOS_PATH` is only ever a read/scan base, so a wrong or empty default just finds nothing to scan rather than writing anywhere unexpected.

**When it points somewhere unreadable or empty.** A directory the user supplies in place of the default is validated to contain at least one directory before it is accepted — in `epics:`, `specify:`, and `document:`, which document that step; `create-ard:`, `design:`, and `release-notes:` offer the same choice without documenting a validation step. Where it runs, validation fails back to the prompt rather than silently accepting a dead path. The default itself is never validated this strictly — a missing or empty `/workspace` on a host without the usual container mounts simply yields zero matched repos, which each repo-dependent skill then treats per its own gate (some, like `design:`, hard-stop on no mounted repos; others degrade to a soft advisory skip — see that skill's own page).

**Directory layout.** See the layout block at the end of this page.

## `$DOCS_PATH`

- **`$DOCS_PATH`** — a read-only clone of your shipped product documentation; defaults to `/workspace/docs` when unset.

**Resolution.** Flags first — `--no-docs` forces grounding off regardless of `$DOCS_PATH`; `--docs <path>` overrides it for that run. Otherwise `docs_root = ${DOCS_PATH:-/workspace/docs}`. A validity gate then has to pass for grounding to turn on at all: `docs_root` must be non-empty, an existing readable directory, and contain at least one markdown file.

**When unset.** The `/workspace/docs` default is probed by the validity gate above; on a host where that path does not exist, the gate simply fails.

**When it points somewhere unreadable, or the gate otherwise fails.** Every miss — unset, missing, unreadable, or no markdown file found — is a **silent, non-blocking skip**: `docs_grounding: OFF` with a one-line internal reason, never an error. Within these seven grounding consumers the plugin never writes into `$DOCS_PATH` under any circumstance.

**Directory layout.** Unlike `$VAULT_PATH` and `$SPECS_PATH`, the plugin imposes no expected substructure here — it searches whatever markdown it finds under the root (for example, a full documentation-site checkout).

## `$GIT_USER_INITIALS`

- **`$GIT_USER_INITIALS`** — your branch identity string; no default, and the plugin never fails when it is absent.

**Resolution.** It is rung 1 of a four-rung identity ladder applied by the five skills that name branches in a *code* repo (`implement:`, `document:` in both modes, `docs-profile:`, `upgrade:`, `vuln:` via `vuln-fixer`) — the specs-repo handoff branches (`idea/`, `vi/`, `ard/`, `spec/`, `design/`, `ready/`) are named by `phase-handoff.md` §2.2 instead and never enter it. The rungs run in order, stopping at the first non-empty result: `$GIT_USER_INITIALS` (used verbatim, never with a trailing `/`) → `git config user.initials` (same semantics, set once per repo or globally) → inference from existing branch names (a candidate accepted at ≥30% of a sampled 200 branches and ≥3 occurrences) → a mandatory prompt if all three yield nothing.

**When unset.** The ladder simply falls through to rung 2, then 3, then the prompt — there is no error, only degradation to a less certain source. Where the target repo's documented branch-naming convention has no name-or-initials segment at all, the variable is simply unused for that repo regardless of whether it is set.

**When it points somewhere unreadable.** Not applicable — this variable holds a literal string, not a path.

**Directory layout.** Not applicable — this variable configures a branch-name segment, not a filesystem location.

## Directory layout

The four directory-valued variables above expect this layout. `$GIT_USER_INITIALS` holds a string, not a path, so it does not appear here.
