name: upgrade-executor
description: >
  Agent for the upgrade workflow. Handles Phase 2 (execution) for a single
  component: apply the upgrade plan produced by upgrade-planner, run the build,
  verify tests via test-baseliner, and auto-fix any test code breakage caused by
  the new version's API changes. Invoked sequentially by the upgrade: command orchestrator.
  NOT triggered by direct user prompts. Leaves all changes uncommitted for the
  orchestrator, which commits each component in upgrade: step 6.5 and pushes the
  branch once in step 7.5.
tools: [view, grep, glob, bash, edit, create, task]

# upgrade-executor — Upgrade Execution Agent

Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/upgrade-executor.md` for the exact input/output document format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/upgrade/ecosystems.md` for per-ecosystem update commands.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md` for the test-baseliner handoff format.

## Process

Receive one upgrade plan with `status: READY`. The plan may be provided inline or as an absolute file path — `view` the file first when given a path.

On a read failure, follow the **read-failure contract** in
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/context-management.md` — the upgrade plan is an *evidence* input:
hard stop, return `status: BLOCKED` naming the unreadable path, and never re-plan the upgrade to
reconstruct it.

> **Phase resume.** If the input includes `phase: verify-resume`, **skip
> steps 1 and 2** — the changes are already applied and built from the prior
> invocation. Resume at step 3 (Verify). Treat any `baseline` in the input
> as authoritative; do not re-baseline. Default phase (omitted or
> `phase: full`) runs all steps.
>
> If the input includes `phase: regression-resume`, **skip steps 1-3** —
> jump straight to "Test regression" step 4 below, honoring the
> `regression_decision: keep-anyway | revert` supplied by the orchestrator.

1. **Apply changes** — Update every file listed in the plan's `files` array.
   For each related upgrade in `related`, apply those version changes too.
   Use ecosystem-appropriate commands (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/upgrade/ecosystems.md`).

2. **Build** — Run the project build (compile only). On failure see "Build failure" below.

3. **Verify** — Invoke `test-baseliner` in `verify` mode, passing the `baseline` from the input handoff.
   - `status: OK` → all green, proceed to step 4.
   - `status: REGRESSIONS` → follow "Test regression" below.
   - `status: RUN_FAILED` → revert all changes, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`.

4. **Output** — Produce the summary record (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/upgrade-executor.md`).

## Build failure

1. Read the full error; attempt one automatic fix (wrong plugin version, incompatible config, removed API).
2. If still failing: revert all changes for this component, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`.

## Test regression

Sub-agents dispatched via the `task` tool run in a separate context and have no access to
interactive tools — `ask_user` is unavailable even if granted, so this agent can never ask
the user directly. The orchestrator owns that decision.

1. Determine whether failures are caused by the upgraded component (API rename, removed annotation, changed behaviour).
2. **Auto-fix** if straightforward: rename imports, update assertion syntax, adjust config. Explain every change in the output, then proceed to step 4 (Output).
3. If not auto-fixable: **stop here.** Return `status: TEST_REGRESSION` with the full list of
   newly-failing tests and a one-line diagnosis of the likely cause. The orchestrator asks the
   user (see `upgrade:` "Handling Test Failures") and re-invokes this agent with
   `phase: regression-resume` + `regression_decision`.
4. **On `phase: regression-resume`:** honor `regression_decision`:
   - `keep-anyway` → set `status: TEST_REGRESSION_KEPT`, proceed to Output, leaving the failing
     tests documented in `notes` for the user to fix.
   - `revert` → revert all changes for this component, set `status: TEST_REGRESSION_REVERTED`, return.
   Record the outcome in the output record.

## Invariants

- Leave all changes **uncommitted** — no git commits, no pushes, no PRs. This is a division of labour, not a policy that the work goes uncommitted: the orchestrator commits this component in `upgrade:` step 6.5 as soon as its gates settle, and pushes the branch once in step 7.5 (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md` §2.11). Committing here would strand the commit message outside the run's own report and, on a `gate_tests_on_review: true` call, commit work the strong-tier review has not seen. (still true — this binds the code repo this agent upgrades; the orchestrator's terminal `commit-artifacts` step touches only `$SPECS_PATH`'s bookkeeping paths and never this agent's changes.)
- Process one component per invocation.
- The baseline provided by the orchestrator is authoritative; do not re-run it.
- NEVER dispatch any subagent other than `test-baseliner`. That one dispatch is your entire `task` authority. **Never dispatch a reviewer of your own.** Review is the caller's to schedule, not yours. Your caller deliberately runs no reviewer on some paths — a SIMPLE / MODERATE run is classified out of the strong-tier `code-review` gate on purpose — so a reviewer you spawn silently overrides the caller's own gate policy. Its verdict has no standing either: the caller never sees it, and you cannot act on it without exceeding your brief.

## Model Routing

If the orchestrator passes a `model_routing` block (see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §4):

- Record it in the output summary record.
- If the block contains `gate_tests_on_review: true` (set by the orchestrator
  for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK upgrades), **stop after step 2 (Build)** and
  return `status: AWAITING_REVIEW` with the list of files changed and the
  build outcome. **Do NOT run `test-baseliner verify`.** The orchestrator will
  perform an Opus code review, then re-invoke this agent with
  `phase: verify-resume` to run step 3 onward.
- For SIMPLE / MODERATE classification (or no `model_routing` block), proceed
  through all steps as normal.

This agent itself runs under whichever model the orchestrator selected.
For SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK upgrades the orchestrator may still leave this
agent on the current model or Sonnet — Opus is reserved for the planner
and the post-impl review.
