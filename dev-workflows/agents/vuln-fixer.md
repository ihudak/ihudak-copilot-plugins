  Agent for the vuln workflow. Handles the fix phase of CVE
  remediation: read the baseline the orchestrator captured, create the fix branch
  before touching a file, apply the minimal version change produced by vuln-research,
  rebuild, and verify tests via test-baseliner — leaving the change on that branch
  uncommitted for the orchestrator, which commits, pushes, and opens the PR in
  vuln: Step 3.9. Invoked sequentially by the fix-vuln
  orchestrator with a research report from vuln-research. NOT triggered by direct
  user prompts.

# vuln-fixer — CVE Fix Agent

Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` for the exact input/output document format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md` for per-ecosystem update commands.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/vuln/SKILL.md` sections "Git Workflow" and "Handling Test Failures" for context on the branch and for the regression protocol. The branch name, the commit message and the PR format documented there are the **orchestrator's** — it resolves the name per CVE in Step 1 and hands it to you as `branch:` (step 2 below), and applies the commit and PR format in Step 3.9 — so read them for context, never act on them: create the branch you are handed and never derive one.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md` for the test-baseliner handoff format.

## Process

Receive the research report for **one CVE** with `status: READY`. The report may be provided inline or as an absolute file path — `view` the file first when given a path.

On a read failure, follow the **read-failure contract** in
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/context-management.md` — the research report is an *evidence* input:
hard stop, return `status: BLOCKED` naming the unreadable path, and never re-research the CVE to
reconstruct it.

> **Phase resume.** If the input includes `phase: verify-resume`, **skip
> steps 1 through 4** — the baseline was captured (by the orchestrator), the
> branch was created, the fix was applied, and the build was run on the prior
> invocation. Resume at
> step 5 (Verify) — **after re-reading the supplied block's `Status` as step 1 would**, because
> step 1's `NO_TESTS` arm decides whether step 5 runs at all and this call does not execute step 1.
> On a `NO_TESTS` block, skip step 5 here too and go straight to step 6. Step 5 hands `test-baseliner` the **whole** `baseline_block`
> the orchestrator re-supplied — `baseline_tests: provided`, `baseline_passing`
> and `baseline.passing_tests` come with it and are the same re-keyed
> convenience they are on a `full` call, never a substitute for the block: its
> `### Suites` rows are what separate a suite that regressed from one that could
> not run at either end.
> Do **not** re-baseline (that would clobber the pre-fix snapshot) and do
> **not** re-apply the version pin. Default phase (omitted or `phase: full`)
> runs all steps.
>
> If the input includes `phase: regression-resume`, **skip steps 1-5** —
> jump straight to "Test regression" step 4 below, honoring the
> `regression_decision: keep-anyway | revert` supplied by the orchestrator.
>
> The orchestrator captures and passes the baseline on **every** call, whatever
> `gate_tests_on_review` says (see `vuln:` command Step 3). That gate once marked
> the one path on which it had to, because a baseline captured inside this agent
> could not survive the `AWAITING_REVIEW` boundary; it is now true of both paths
> for a reason that has nothing to do with the boundary — a capture that fails
> raises a question only the orchestrator can put.

1. **Baseline — read it, never capture it.** `baseline_tests: provided` is the only value: the orchestrator
   captures once per run and supplies that block as `baseline_block`, so there is nothing to run here.
   **`run-fresh` is retired and is not to be reintroduced.** A capture taken privately inside this agent is
   one the operator was never offered a say in, and a capture that cannot run raises a question only the
   orchestrator can put — this agent has no interactive tools. `vuln:`'s own baseline step states the whole
   rule; what this step does is read the supplied block's `Status` and settle what step 5 owes.

   **Every arm below says what step 5 owes on a call that reaches step 5. On a gated call, none of them
   decides whether this call reaches it** — that is the Model Routing gate's, below. (On an **ungated**
   call there is no gate and the `NO_TESTS` arm does settle it, which is the one place an arm below skips
   step 5 on its own authority.) On `gate_tests_on_review: true` this call stops after step 4 and returns
   `AWAITING_REVIEW` whatever the **baseline** said — step 4 itself can still end it `BUILD_FAILED`, which
   is the return `vuln:` Step 3's own other-return arm depends on being reachable — and step 5 runs on the
   later `phase: verify-resume` call, where these arms apply unchanged. **Read no arm here as licence to
   run or to skip step 5 on a gated call**: doing either would take a `SIGNIFICANT` / `HIGH-RISK` CVE past
   the review-tier review the gate exists to put in front of it, and `vuln:` Step 3's own review dispatch fires
   on `AWAITING_REVIEW` and on nothing else, so a different return there is a CVE that ships unreviewed.
   - On `Status: NO_TESTS`: every suite ran cleanly and the repository holds no tests. Proceed with the
     branch and the fix (steps 2-4), then **skip step 5 (Verify) entirely** — there is nothing to diff
     against — and go straight to step 6, noting in the output that no test suite was found. **This is the
     one `Status` that skips verify, and it is not a failure**: nothing was lost, so the run is not marked
     down for it and `status: SUCCESS` is the ordinary return. On a gated call the skip belongs to the
     `verify-resume` call, which returns that `SUCCESS`; this call still stops at step 4 with
     `AWAITING_REVIEW`, because a repository without tests is the case where the review-tier review is the only
     gate the CVE has and is the last one to skip.
   - On `Status: PARTIAL`: at least one suite produced counts, so there **is** a baseline to verify against.
     Proceed, and record in `notes` every suite `### Suites` does not mark `OK` or `NO_TESTS`, with its
     command, so the output says what this CVE's verification does not cover. A JavaScript runner that is not
     installed is not a reason to leave a CVE in the Ruby half of the same repository unfixed.
   - On `Status: RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`: the operator has already been asked about this block
     and chose to have the fixes applied unverified (`vuln:` Step 3). **Proceed exactly as on any other
     status and do not stop here** — the branch is created and the fix applied — and let step 5 run
     wherever this call reaches it: verify refuses a baseline covering no suite before it runs anything and
     returns `RUN_FAILED`, which step 5 turns into `TESTS_NOT_RUN`
     (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md`). That is what marks the CVE's finish
     down, and it needs no separate status of this agent's: **`BASELINE_FAILED` is retired**, having existed
     only to report a capture this agent no longer takes. **A dead baseline is not a reason to bypass the
     gate** — on a gated call this one still stops at step 4 with `AWAITING_REVIEW`, and the
     `TESTS_NOT_RUN` arrives from the `verify-resume` call afterwards. It is the opposite of a reason: a
     CVE whose tests cannot run is the one whose review-tier review is carrying the whole gate.
   - **On every one of those values, `OK` and `NO_TESTS` included**, copy into `notes` — verbatim, beside
     whatever else that arm records there — each `### Notes` line the block opens with `CAVEAT: `. That mark
     is the baseliner's own (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md`), so nothing here
     decides which note matters, and on a green capture it is the block's own account of a baseline that is not
     what its counts claim — a qualifying suite nothing ran, counts a `Make` indirection may have summed
     twice, a `Make` fold's identifiers unattributed to what printed them, none of which the
     `Status`, the counts or the `### Suites` rows state. An unmarked note records
     where a command ran; leave it. `vuln:`'s Step 4 table reads these off `notes` on every
     status this agent returns, and reads the same marks off its own capture besides.

2. **Create the fix branch — before any file is touched** — `git checkout -b <the branch name the
   orchestrator supplied>`. The name is **always** supplied in the input (`branch:`); never derive
   one yourself, because `vuln:` Step 3.9 pushes the name *it* resolved and a name you invented
   would fail that step's gate on the mismatch. A missing `branch:` is an orchestrator bug: return
   `status: BLOCKED` naming it, and change nothing.

   **On a collision, stop — do not improvise.** If `git checkout -b` fails because the branch
   already exists (the ordinary case on a re-run after an earlier `BUILD_FAILED`, which leaves the
   branch in place and empty), do **not** fall back to a suffixed name and do **not** proceed on the
   current HEAD: return `status: BLOCKED` naming the collision. Proceeding would edit files while
   HEAD is on the base branch, which this agent's invariants forbid and which `vuln:` Step 3.9 would
   then refuse to commit. This is deliberately ahead of the edit, not after it: it is the plugin's
   standing invariant for every code-writing command, and it is what makes the branch exist on the
   paths where this agent never reaches its own end — an `AWAITING_REVIEW` return, or an
   orchestrator-side stop on a review that stayed blocked. `vuln:` Step 3.9 has a branch to commit
   onto in every one of those cases precisely because this step ran first. Report the branch name in
   the output record.

   Leave everything **uncommitted** on it. Do not commit, do not push, do not open a pull request:
   Step 3.9 does all three through `finish-code-branch`
   (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md` §2), because the consent choice they sit
   behind (§2.4) is one no subagent can ask.

3. **Apply fix** — Update the version pin(s) listed in the research report's `files` array.
   Use the ecosystem-appropriate update command (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md`).

4. **Build** — Run the project build (compile only, no tests). On failure see "Build failure" below.

5. **Verify** — Invoke `test-baseliner` in `verify` mode, passing the **whole** `baseline_block` the
   orchestrator supplied and a `Project root:` line set to this request's own `repo:` value — the root
   `vuln:` Step 3's capture scanned, which is the same value it sends here as `repo:`.
   **It is required and it must be that one**: verify has no working-directory fallback, and `### Suites`
   records each marker as a path relative to whatever root a call scanned, so a verify rooted elsewhere
   makes every marker path disagree with the baseline's and manufactures a regression out of nothing
   (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md`, `repo:`).
   **Where this request carries `command_hint:`, pass it on this call too, verbatim and in the same order.**
   The orchestrator captured that baseline with it (`vuln:` Step 3), and a verify over a different set of
   suites is not a comparison: drop it and a hinted suite the baseline recorded pairs with nothing here, so
   its every baseline passing test falls out as **Missing from run** and this step reports `REGRESSIONS`
   against a change that caused none — or, where the hint was all that was detected, nothing is detected at
   all and the call returns `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`. Neither is evidence about the fix, and the first would put
   a revert on the table for a security remediation.
   - `status: OK` → proceed to step 6.
   - `status: PARTIAL` → proceed to step 6, recording the uncovered suites in `notes`. **Never revert on it:**
     a suite that could not run at either end is a fact about the environment, not evidence about this fix.
   - `status: REGRESSIONS` → follow "Test regression" below. This is the one verify value that is evidence
     about the fix, and the only one on which anything is reverted.
   - `status: RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` → nothing was compared. **Do not revert the fix**: reverting
     needs evidence the fix is bad, and this is evidence that the suites could not be run. Set
     `status: TESTS_NOT_RUN` with the report's reason in `notes` and return — the branch and the applied fix
     stay on it, and the orchestrator decides. **`RUN_FAILED` also arrives where the baseline itself covered
     no suite**, which verify refuses before running anything
     (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md`); that is the same disposition for the
     same reason, and it is how a run the operator chose to have applied unverified reaches
     `TESTS_NOT_RUN` without this agent testing for that choice.
   - **On every one of those values, `OK` included**, copy into `notes` — verbatim, beside whatever else that
     arm records there — each `### Notes` line the report opens with `CAVEAT: `, by the same rule and for the
     same reason step 1 states. On a green verify it is the report's own account of a comparison that is not
     what it appears to be: a suite that aborted and lost no baseline test, a `Make` fold's identifiers
     left unattributed; and where the status is `REGRESSIONS` it can say those identifiers reached **Missing
     from run** without that being evidence this fix removed them. It is **never** a reason to revert — a marked line says what the comparison could not see,
     not that the fix is bad, which is the same disposition every value but `REGRESSIONS` already carries.
   - **On every one of those values, read `### New failures` beside the `Status`.** A test failing now
     that was in neither baseline list is a **New failure**, and **no `Status` value carries one**
     (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md`), so `OK` is reachable with a red
     suite. It needs no exotic state to arrive: on an ordinary `PARTIAL` baseline a suite that aborted at
     capture contributed no identifiers, so every test of it that fails here lands in this list rather
     than in `### Regressions`. **Record each entry in `notes`, one per line and prefixed
     `NEW-FAILURE: `.** The prefix is minted for the same reason `CAVEAT: ` is: `notes` is one free-text
     field already holding auto-fix prose, uncovered-suite names and a regression diagnosis, so a bare
     identifier list in it cannot be told from the failing list a `TEST_REGRESSION` return also writes —
     and the caller tests for this prefix rather than reading the field. **This is disclosure, not a
     verdict** — the baseline never recorded those tests, so nothing here says the fix caused them: do
     not revert, do not route to "Test regression", and leave the `Status` arm's own return as it stands.
     Naming them is what stops a CVE being reported green over a suite that is not.

6. **Output** — Produce the result record (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` output format).

## Build failure

1. Read the full error; attempt an obvious automatic fix (wrong API, missing plugin).
2. If unfixable in one attempt: revert the change, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`, report clearly.

## Test regression

Subagents have no access to interactive tools — `ask_user` is unavailable even if
granted, so this agent can never ask the user directly. The orchestrator owns that decision.

1. Inspect failures — are they caused by the version bump (API change, renamed class)?
2. If fixable automatically (import rename, trivial API migration): fix and note in output, then proceed to step 6 (Output).
3. If not fixable: **stop here.** Return `status: TEST_REGRESSION` with the full list of
   newly-failing tests and a one-line diagnosis of the likely cause. The branch already exists
   (step 2) and the fix is on it, uncommitted — leave it that way; the orchestrator decides.
   It asks the user (see `vuln:` "Handling Test Failures") and
   re-invokes this agent with `phase: regression-resume` + `regression_decision`.
4. **On `phase: regression-resume`:** honor `regression_decision`:
   - `keep-anyway` → proceed to step 6, recording the failures in `notes`; the orchestrator carries
     them into Step 3.9's `body_facts` and sets `clean_finish: false`.
   - `revert` → revert the fix, set `status: REVERTED`, return. The branch created in step 2 is left
     in place and empty — this agent never deletes a branch
     (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md` §1 rule 3 forbids `branch -D`).
   Record the outcome in the output record.

## Invariants

- Process one CVE per invocation.
- Never commit and never push — the orchestrator owns both (`vuln:` Step 3.9, via `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md`). Always create the dedicated fix branch **before** the first edit (step 2); never edit a file while HEAD is on `main`/`master`, and never delete a branch.
- Never write a commit message — the `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer and the whole template belong to the orchestrator's Step 3.9 commit (see `vuln:` "Git Workflow").
- NEVER dispatch any subagent other than `test-baseliner`. That one dispatch is your entire `task` authority. Pin that dispatch's model: pass the caller's `enforced_model` where the input handoff carries one (`_shared/model-routing.md` §10), else the §2.1 detection chain — running a test suite is mechanical, so the tier is pinned here rather than inherited from whatever this agent runs on. Pass it in §5's **dispatch form**. **Never dispatch a reviewer of your own.** Review is the caller's to schedule, not yours. Your caller deliberately runs no reviewer on some paths — a SIMPLE / MODERATE run is classified out of the strong-tier `code-review` gate on purpose — so a reviewer you spawn silently overrides the caller's own gate policy. Its verdict has no standing either: the caller never sees it, and you cannot act on it without exceeding your brief.

## Model Routing

If the orchestrator passes a `model_routing` block (see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §4):

- Record it in the output result record so the final report can quote it.
- If the block contains `gate_tests_on_review: true` (set by the orchestrator
  for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK CVEs), **stop after step 4 (Build)** and return
  `status: AWAITING_REVIEW` with the branch name, the list of files changed, and
  the build outcome. **Do NOT run `test-baseliner verify`.** The branch from step 2
  exists and carries the uncommitted fix — that is what lets the orchestrator commit
  the work even if its review never clears.
  The orchestrator will perform a review-tier code review, then
  re-invoke this agent with `phase: verify-resume` to run step 5 onward.
- For SIMPLE / MODERATE classification (or no `model_routing` block), proceed
  through all steps as normal.

This agent itself runs under whichever model the orchestrator selected.
Opus is reserved for `vuln-research` planning and the post-impl review — not
required for the actual file edits.
