description: >
  Agent for the vuln workflow. Handles the fix phase of CVE
  remediation: capture baseline via test-baseliner, apply the minimal version
  change produced by vuln-research, rebuild, verify tests via test-baseliner,
  and create the fix branch — leaving the change on it uncommitted for the
  orchestrator, which commits, pushes, and opens the PR in vuln: Step 3.9.
  Invoked sequentially by the fix-vuln
  orchestrator with a research report from vuln-research. NOT triggered by direct
  user prompts.

# vuln-fixer — CVE Fix Agent

Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` for the exact input/output document format.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md` for per-ecosystem update commands.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/vuln/SKILL.md` sections "Git Workflow" and "Handling Test Failures" for branch naming and the regression protocol. The commit message and PR format documented there are the **orchestrator's** to apply in Step 3.9 — read them for context, never act on them.
Read `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/test-baseliner.md` for the test-baseliner handoff format.

## Process

Receive the research report for **one CVE** with `status: READY`. The report may be provided inline or as an absolute file path — `view` the file first when given a path.

On a read failure, follow the **read-failure contract** in
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/context-management.md` — the research report is an *evidence* input:
hard stop, return `status: BLOCKED` naming the unreadable path, and never re-research the CVE to
reconstruct it.

> **Phase resume.** If the input includes `phase: verify-resume`, **skip
> steps 1 through 4** — the baseline was captured (by the orchestrator), the
> branch was created, the fix was applied, and the build was run on the prior
> invocation. Resume at
> step 5 (Verify), using the `baseline_tests: provided` + `baseline_passing`
> + `baseline.passing_tests` re-supplied by the orchestrator in the input.
> Do **not** re-baseline (that would clobber the pre-fix snapshot) and do
> **not** re-apply the version pin. Default phase (omitted or `phase: full`)
> runs all steps.
>
> If the input includes `phase: regression-resume`, **skip steps 1-5** —
> jump straight to "Test regression" step 4 below, honoring the
> `regression_decision: keep-anyway | revert` supplied by the orchestrator.
>
> When `gate_tests_on_review: true` is set on a `phase: full` call, the
> orchestrator is required to capture and pass the baseline itself (see
> `vuln:` command Step 3); under that gate, **`baseline_tests:
> run-fresh` is invalid** because the captured baseline cannot survive the
> AWAITING_REVIEW boundary.

1. **Baseline** — If `baseline_tests: run-fresh`, invoke `test-baseliner` in `capture` mode.
   If `baseline_tests: provided`, the orchestrator has already captured the baseline — skip this step.
   - On `status: RUN_FAILED` or `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`: set output `status: BASELINE_FAILED`, return —
     before step 2, so no branch is created for a CVE that was never worked.
   - On `status: NO_TESTS`: the project has no runnable test suite. Proceed with the branch and the fix
     (steps 2-4), then **skip step 5 (Verify) entirely** — there is nothing to diff against —
     and go straight to step 6, noting in the output that no test suite was found.

2. **Create the fix branch — before any file is touched** — `git checkout -b <the branch name the
   orchestrator supplied>`. This is deliberately ahead of the edit, not after it: it is the plugin's
   standing invariant for every code-writing skill, and it is what makes the branch exist on the
   paths where this agent never reaches its own end — an `AWAITING_REVIEW` return, or an
   orchestrator-side stop at an unresolved `BLOCK`. `vuln:` Step 3.9 has a branch to commit onto in
   every one of those cases precisely because this step ran first. Report the branch name in the
   output record.

   Leave everything **uncommitted** on it. Do not commit, do not push, do not open a pull request:
   Step 3.9 does all three through `finish-code-branch`
   (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md` §2), because the consent choice they sit
   behind (§2.4) is one no sub-agent can ask.

3. **Apply fix** — Update the version pin(s) listed in the research report's `files` array.
   Use the ecosystem-appropriate update command (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/fix-vuln/build-systems.md`).

4. **Build** — Run the project build (compile only, no tests). On failure see "Build failure" below.

5. **Verify** — Invoke `test-baseliner` in `verify` mode, passing the baseline from step 1.
   - `status: OK` → proceed to step 6.
   - `status: REGRESSIONS` → follow "Test regression" below.
   - `status: RUN_FAILED` → revert fix, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`, return.

6. **Output** — Produce the result record (see `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/handoff/vuln-fixer.md` output format).

## Build failure

1. Read the full error; attempt an obvious automatic fix (wrong API, missing plugin).
2. If unfixable in one attempt: revert the change, set `status: BUILD_FAILED`, report clearly.

## Test regression

Sub-agents dispatched via the `task` tool run in a separate context and have no access to
interactive tools — `ask_user` is unavailable even if granted, so this agent can never ask
the user directly. The orchestrator owns that decision.

1. Inspect failures — are they caused by the version bump (API change, renamed class)?
2. If fixable automatically (import rename, trivial API migration): fix and note in output, then proceed to step 6 (Output).
3. If not fixable: **stop here.** Return `status: TEST_REGRESSION` with the full list of
   newly-failing tests and a one-line diagnosis of the likely cause. The branch already exists
   (step 2) and the fix is on it, uncommitted — leave it that way; the orchestrator decides.
   It asks the user (see `vuln:` "Handling Test Failures") and
   re-invokes this agent with `phase: regression-resume` + `regression_decision`.
4. **On `phase: regression-resume`:** honor `regression_decision`:
   - `keep-anyway` → proceed to step 6, recording the failures in `notes`; the orchestrator carries
     them into Step 3.9's `body_facts` and sets `clean_finish: false`.
   - `revert` → revert the fix, set `status: REVERTED`, return. The branch created in step 2 is left
     in place and empty — this agent never deletes a branch
     (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md` §1 rule 3 forbids `branch -D`).
   Record the outcome in the output record.

## Invariants

- Process one CVE per invocation.
- Never commit and never push — the orchestrator owns both (`vuln:` Step 3.9, via `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/code-repo-handoff.md`). Always create the dedicated fix branch **before** the first edit (step 2); never edit a file while HEAD is on `main`/`master`, and never delete a branch.
- Never write a commit message — the `Co-authored-by: Copilot` trailer and the whole template belong to the orchestrator's Step 3.9 commit (see `vuln:` "Git Workflow").
- NEVER dispatch any subagent other than `test-baseliner`. That one dispatch is your entire `task` authority. **Never dispatch a reviewer of your own.** Review is the caller's to schedule, not yours. Your caller deliberately runs no reviewer on some paths — a SIMPLE / MODERATE run is classified out of the strong-tier `code-review` gate on purpose — so a reviewer you spawn silently overrides the caller's own gate policy. Its verdict has no standing either: the caller never sees it, and you cannot act on it without exceeding your brief.

## Model Routing

If the orchestrator passes a `model_routing` block (see
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/model-routing.md` §4):

- Record it in the output result record so the final report can quote it.
- If the block contains `gate_tests_on_review: true` (set by the orchestrator
  for SIGNIFICANT / HIGH-RISK CVEs), **stop after step 4 (Build)** and return
  `status: AWAITING_REVIEW` with the branch name, the list of files changed, and
  the build outcome. **Do NOT run `test-baseliner verify`.** The branch from step 2
  exists and carries the uncommitted fix — that is what lets the orchestrator commit
  the work even if its review never clears.
  The orchestrator will perform an Opus code review, then
  re-invoke this agent with `phase: verify-resume` to run step 5 onward.
- For SIMPLE / MODERATE classification (or no `model_routing` block), proceed
  through all steps as normal.

This agent itself runs under whichever model the orchestrator selected.
Opus is reserved for `vuln-research` planning and the post-impl review — not
required for the actual file edits.
