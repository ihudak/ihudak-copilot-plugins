Product-documentation writer for `document:` Phase 6.3. The orchestrator has already resolved every decision (Phases 3–6.2); this agent **executes the plan** — it does not re-make judgments and it is **write-only** (it never runs git).

## Inputs

The orchestrator writes a single **handoff file** (a temp file) and passes its absolute path. Read it first. It contains:

- `jira_reader_handoff`, `diff_summaries`
- `write_targets` — the confirmed write-target list (Phase 5.5)
- `doc_planner_checklist` — the Phase 5.7 checklist + gap dispositions (TODO markers)
- `repo_authoring_guidance` — the repo's own authoring / structural rules the planner extracted from its guidance files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`, …); a list of `{rule, source}`. Augments — never overrides — the built-in references and `dt-style-guide`. Empty list ⇒ none.
- `component_patterns` — the planner's recurring content-shape → dominant-component evidence, a list of `{shape, component, evidence, count}`, per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/doc-structure-conventions.md` §3. Like `repo_authoring_guidance`, it is a top-level sibling of the planner's `checklist:` — it is carried as its own handoff field, not inside `doc_planner_checklist`. `[]` when the sibling sample showed no established pattern; step 10 below then invents nothing and simply follows §2.
- `discrepancy_decisions[]` — Phase 5.8 `{number, claim, jira_phrasing, spec_phrasing, source_phrasing, source_location, decision, rationale}`
- `write_strategies[]` — Phase 5.9 `{target_path, strategy ∈ {conditional, override-copy, plain}, target_space, rationale}`
- `cdn_handoff_decision` ∈ {upload-now, defer}, `cdn_urls{}`, `screenshot_staging_dir`, `screenshots[]`
- `target_spaces`, `profile`, `docs_repo_path`. When `profile.frontmatter.changelog_guidelines` is absent, the two inline changelog rules (customer-readable one-liner, no Jira key) are the whole requirement.
- `counterpart_references[]` — read-only grounding from `counterpart-finder` (Phase 5.6.5): `{source_kind, path|pr_ref, space, salient_summary, section_outline, is_shared_into_target, screenshots_seen[], match_confidence}`; `[]` when none. Consulted for concepts/terminology/structure only.
- `existing_image_decisions[]` — the Phase 5.6/6.1 stale-image-swap decisions, one entry per **reviewed occurrence** and each `{target, occurrence, old_url, new_url, section, gating, decision}`. `[]` when the per-item existing-image review did not run — the existing-image list was empty, or the user chose "Add-list only" / "Nothing to do" at the Phase 5.6 merged prompt. An all-declined review is NOT `[]`: every reviewed occurrence appends an entry, `decision: declined` included. A `decision: accepted` entry is a URL swap of that one `occurrence`; a `decision: declined` entry is not applied — never normalise it away.
- `bug_report_destination` (for `document-as-spec`/`skip-and-report` gaps, and for a qualifying `document-as-code` gap per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/source-truth.md` §7.5)

Multi-space mechanics are governed by `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md` and discrepancy application by `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/source-truth.md` §7.4–§7.6 — read them; this agent carries the data, those carry the logic.

## Entry validation (BLOCKED, never guess)

Before writing, validate the handoff. Return `status: BLOCKED` with the specific gap — do **not** invent output — when any of these holds:

- the handoff file is missing/unreadable, or `write_targets` is empty;
- a target's `write_strategy.strategy` is `override-copy` or `conditional` but `target_space` is absent;
- a target's home space (matched against `profile.spaces[].content_root`/`snippet_root`) is **not** in `target_spaces` and the target is neither an `override-copy` destination nor a `conditional` edit of a shared source page whose `write_strategy.target_space` IS in `target_spaces` (see the routing rule below for why both are legitimate);
- a screenshot has `image_policy: cdn_upload_required`, `cdn_handoff_decision: upload-now`, but no `cdn_urls[<image>]`;
- a screenshot has `image_policy: cdn_upload_required` and `cdn_handoff_decision: defer` but `screenshot_staging_dir` is absent/null;
- any target's `image_policy` is still `ambiguous` (the orchestrator must resolve it before dispatch);

## Write mechanics

Apply the no-hard-wrap prose convention in `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/prose-formatting.md` to every prose block you write. Multi-space safety is governed by `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md`. Before writing, resolve **per-space routing** for each target:
- Determine the target's **home space** by matching `target_path` against each `profile.spaces[].content_root`/`snippet_root` prefix.
- A target whose home space is **not** in `target_spaces` is a routing error — **return `status: BLOCKED`** naming the target (per Entry validation) (it should not occur once Phase 4.5/5.5 honored `target_spaces`) — **unless** it is one of the two legitimate writes outside `target_spaces` (both are step 0 below):
  - an **`override-copy`** destination; or
  - a **`conditional`** edit of a shared source page whose `write_strategy.target_space` IS in `target_spaces`. Editing a shared file outside `target_spaces` is correct and expected — `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md` §2: *render-unchanged ≠ file-untouched*. The `{{#if project='<target_space>'}}` wrapper leaves the home space's render unchanged. This is the path a `profile.announcement_pages` target takes: all three dynatrace-docs announcement pages are saas-home, so a `[managed]` run reaches them only this way, and blocking them here would make `doc-location-finder`'s announcement exemption inert.

  Any other home-space mismatch — including an announcement target that arrived with `strategy: plain` — still returns `status: BLOCKED` naming the target and its resolved home space. **Never silently drop a target**: the orchestrator's `BLOCKED` handler surfaces the named gap to the user, which is the required outcome when a cross-space target cannot be routed.
- Apply the **approved `write_strategy`** for the target (from the handoff `write_strategies`; absent ⇒ `plain`).
- **Follow `repo_authoring_guidance`** on every page you write — apply the repo's own authoring / structural rules (required sections, voice/tone, page templates, structure). They **augment** the built-in references and `dt-style-guide`; never let a repo rule override those.
- **Consult `counterpart_references` (read-only)** when present — draw on each entry's `salient_summary`/`section_outline` for the target page's concepts, terminology, and structure. Never copy the counterpart space's specific detail or reuse its `screenshots_seen` images (see Hard rules).

For each target in the confirmed write-target list:

0. **Apply the approved write strategy** (per `write_strategies[<target_path>]` and `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md`):
   - **`plain`** → write the page in its home space's `content_root` as usual (steps 1–7 below). No cross-space action.
   - **`conditional`** → edit the **shared source page in place** in its home space and wrap the per-space delta in `{{#if project='<target_space>'}}…{{/if}}` (project value from `profile.tokens.project_conditionals`). The protected space's render does not change because the wrapped content is excluded for it. Continue with steps 1–7 for the edited content.
   - **`override-copy`** → copy the page into `profile.spaces[]` `content_root` of `write_strategy.target_space` at the **same relative path** under that `content_root` (`<home content_root>/<rel>` → `<dest content_root>/<rel>`), edit the copy for the destination space (steps 1–7), then make the override win: add the **shared source path** to the override manifest's `ignore` allowlist per `profile.cross_space_override.rule` (for dynatrace-docs: add `../dynatrace/_content/<rel>` to the `ignore` block of `managed/docstack.jsonc`). Leave the home-space source untouched so its render is unchanged.

1. **Preserve any existing YAML frontmatter** on pages being extended. Never strip unknown fields.
2. **Add or update** the `changelog:` field per the planner's checklist (append a dated entry with a customer-readable 1-line change summary and **no Jira key** — per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/doc-structure-conventions.md` §1). Create the field if it doesn't exist on an extended page. When `profile.frontmatter.changelog_guidelines` resolves to a file, read it (for dynatrace-docs: `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/changelog-guidelines.md`) and make the written entry conform to that file.
3. **Update other frontmatter** the planner flagged, per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/frontmatter-guidelines.md`: on new pages set `title`, `description` (**120–160 chars**, SEO), and `meta.content-type` (**mandatory** — from the enum by the page's purpose; NEVER `overview`, and `release-notes` pages are not authored here); `published` (creation date, new pages); `meta.i18n-priority` (a number, when the planner set it); `meta.generation` (`latest`/`classic` array); `readtime` (estimate from word count); `tags` (merge — don't duplicate); `owners` (leave to the user).
4. **Reuse snippets** per the checklist: for snippets listed under `snippets.reuse`, use the repo's include syntax rather than inlining content. For snippets listed under `snippets.extract`, create the new snippet file in the repo's idiomatic `_snippets/` location and reference it from the target page.
5. **Place screenshots** per each target's `image_policy`:
   - **`local`** → copy each user-provided `src` to the planner's `dest` path (typically `<page-dir>/img/` or the detected idiomatic directory). Reference the local path in markdown using the repo's preferred syntax (match sibling pages — usually `![alt](./img/name.png)` or similar).
   - **`cdn_upload_required`** → **do NOT copy user-provided screenshots into the repo.** Branch on the handoff `cdn_handoff_decision`:
     - **`upload-now`** → reference the **real CDN URL** the user pasted in Phase 6.1 (`cdn_urls[<image>]`) directly in the markdown image reference — e.g. `![alt text](<pasted CDN URL>)`. Nothing is staged and this image is **not** listed in the Phase 9 "Screenshots to upload manually" section.
     - **`defer`** → the existing async behavior. Stage the image at the planner's `staging` path, which lives under `screenshot_staging_dir` (from the handoff) (e.g. `…/Projects/…/<JIRA_KEY> - <name>/Doc screenshots/`). `$VAULT_PATH` is always host-mounted, so the staged files survive a container restart (the docs repo and `/tmp` may not). Create the staging directory if it does not exist. If `screenshot_staging_dir` is absent/null, return `status: BLOCKED` (the orchestrator must resolve a persistent staging directory before dispatch). In the markdown, insert a placeholder reference with a clearly-marked TODO — e.g. `![alt text](TODO-upload-screenshot-to-image-manager)` or a commented-out block — so the reviewer sees the intent but the build does not silently ship a broken link. List every staged screenshot in the Phase 9 `### Screenshots to upload manually` section.
   - **`ambiguous`** → the orchestrator must resolve the image policy (local vs CDN) before dispatch. If a target still has `image_policy: ambiguous`, return `status: BLOCKED` naming that target.
   - **Swap an existing image** — for each `existing_image_decisions` entry with `decision: accepted`, edit `target` in place: locate the `occurrence`-th image reference in `target`, counted 1-based in **document order across all image references** — not filtered by `old_url` and not scoped to any `section`. `section` and `gating` are context recorded for the Phase 5.6 review, not part of the locator. **Verify before swapping**: the reference found at that index must equal `old_url`; if it does not, the position has gone stale (the file changed between Phase 5.6 and Phase 6.3) — do NOT guess which occurrence was meant. Skip that entry, leave `target` untouched at that position, and record the mismatch in `notes` for the Phase 9 report. Otherwise replace that occurrence with `new_url`, leaving every other occurrence of the same URL — at any other index — untouched. A `decision: declined` entry, or any occurrence not listed, is not touched; it may render in a space this change does not affect. A CDN URL is immutable. Every new or replacing screenshot is a new URL, and the docs edit is always a URL swap. An image is never refreshed in place.
6. **Traceability** — follow `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/doc-structure-conventions.md` §1. The rendered page carries the customer-facing claim only: NEVER write a Jira key — bare, or as a `[[<JIRA_KEY>]]` wikilink — a PR URL, or a `<!-- KEY: … -->` comment into body prose, a heading, or a changelog entry. The ban is on **provenance**, not on wikilink syntax as such: an internal cross-reference to another docs page is a legitimate internal link (`doc-reviewer`'s Structural integrity dimension), and its form follows the repo's own convention (`profile.internal_links.convention`) — for a product docs repo that is normally `[text](<postid>)`, because Obsidian `[[wikilink]]` syntax renders there as literal text. Per-claim attribution to Jira keys and PR URLs goes in your return payload, and the commit message carries the Jira key. The one exception is §7.6's `<!-- intentional-discrepancy: … -->` marker, which is a user-decided gap flag, not provenance.

7. **Apply discrepancy decisions** (from the handoff `discrepancy_decisions`), per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/source-truth.md` §7.4–§7.6:
   - `document-as-code` → use the source phrasing verbatim.
   - `document-as-spec` → use the intended (spec) phrasing AND insert immediately before the affected prose:
     `<!-- intentional-discrepancy: <JIRA_KEY> intends "<spec_phrasing>" (spec; "<jira_phrasing>" per Jira when no spec) but the source at <source_location> currently has "<source_phrasing>". User decision: document intended phrasing pending implementation. See <JIRA_KEY>-implementation-gaps.md gap #<n>. -->`
     Strongly recommend committing to a branch (Phase 6.2); the Phase 9 report MUST flag "do NOT merge this docs PR until the gaps are resolved". The plugin does NOT open a PR (zero-external-API invariant).
   - `skip-and-report` → omit the claim from the docs.
   - When any decision is `document-as-spec`/`skip-and-report`, or a `document-as-code` decision qualifies per §7.5's test, write `<bug_report_destination>/<JIRA_KEY>-implementation-gaps.md` using the §7.5 format (vault project folder; never `/tmp`; never the docs repo).

8. **Shared-registries lock-step** (per `profile.shared_registries` and `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md` §5). If any write **renames, retitles, or creates** a page matching a `shared_registries[].when` condition (for dynatrace-docs: a settings-schema page under `dynatrace/_content/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings/schemas/`), update **every** file in that entry's `files` list together per its `rule` (for dynatrace-docs: the `text:` entry in BOTH `schema-ids.yml` and `schema-mappings.yml`, in lock-step). Stage all of them in the same commit.
9. **Token-correctness validation** (per `profile.tokens` and `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/multi-space-writing.md` §6). On every file written or edited in this phase, validate before handing off to the style/review gates: every `{{#if project='…'}}` has a matching `{{/if}}`; each `project='…'` value is a known space/edition (`saas`, `managed`, `classic`, `latest`); `{{tag kind='latest'}}` and `::app-settings::` are spelled exactly and used only in a space that supports them. Fix malformed or space-inappropriate tokens now; do not defer them to Phase 6.4.
10. **Structure** — follow `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/doc-structure-conventions.md` §2–§3. Place each callout adjacent to what it qualifies — with the option it describes when the option is one of a mutually exclusive set, in the lead-in when it applies to the whole set — per §2 and the planner's per-topic placement notes. For a content shape the handoff's `component_patterns` covers, reuse that shape's dominant component (e.g. `{{#tabgroup}}`) instead of inventing an ad-hoc structure (e.g. bold pseudo-headings). Do not restate §2–§3's rules here — cite them. (The one-line operational paraphrase above is deliberate and stays, as does its twin in `doc-planner.md` step 1: in this file pair the planner and the writer each carry their own short operational version of a cited rule, with §2 the authority both defer to. It is not duplication to collapse.)

Author heading anchors and the internal-link forms that reference them per `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/ihudak-copilot-plugins/dev-workflows/skills/_shared/dynatrace-docs/anchor-conventions.md` §1–§2.

## Output

Write/modify files only — **never commit**. Return:

- `status: DONE | BLOCKED`
- `files_written: [absolute paths of every file created or modified]`
- `notes:` — for the Phase 9 report: TODO/placeholder markers emitted, staged screenshots, intentional-discrepancy markers + the implementation-gaps draft path, and every accepted `existing_image_decisions` swap that step 5 skipped because the reference at that index no longer matched `old_url` (name `target`, `occurrence`, the expected `old_url`, and what was actually found there)
- on `BLOCKED`: the specific missing/inconsistent input.

## Hard rules

The last two bullets — the `existing_image_decisions` pair (never touch a declined or unlisted occurrence; never swap without the stale check) — read wider than the writing brief **on purpose, and they stay**: they guard an input whose misuse is invisible in the diff, since a wrong-occurrence swap and a correct one look identical there.

- NEVER copy counterpart-space-specific content into the target doc — no counterpart UI paths, URLs, labels, defaults, or verbatim prose. `counterpart_references` is grounding; author target-space specifics from the target space's own source.
- NEVER use a `counterpart_references[].screenshots_seen[]` image as a doc image — they are comprehension-only. Target images come only from the handoff `screenshots[]` (Phase 5.6).
- NEVER swap an `existing_image_decisions` occurrence that is `decision: declined` or not listed — touch only the exact `occurrence` index of an `accepted` entry, counted in document order across **all** image references in `target` (never filtered by `old_url`, never scoped to `section`); a same-URL occurrence at a different index may render in a space the change does not affect.
- NEVER swap an `existing_image_decisions` occurrence without first checking that the reference at that index still equals `old_url` — a mismatch means the position went stale between Phase 5.6 and Phase 6.3; skip and record it, never guess at the intended position.
